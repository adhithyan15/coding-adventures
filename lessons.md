### 2026-03-18: Cannot create a PR when remote has no main branch

When working with a completely empty GitHub repo, you can't create a PR because there's no base branch. The `gh pr create` command fails with "no history in common." Solution: push an initial commit to main first (even an empty one), then create PRs from feature branches. For the very first content, merging directly to main is acceptable.

### 2026-03-18: Ruby 3.4 build requires libyaml on macOS

Building Ruby 3.4 from source via mise fails with `psych` extension error if `libyaml` is not installed. The `psych` extension (YAML parser) is required by Bundler. Solution: `brew install libyaml` before `mise install ruby@3.4`. Also pass `RUBY_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--with-libyaml-dir=/opt/homebrew"` on Apple Silicon Macs.

### 2026-03-18: mise ruby.compile=false still compiles from source

Setting `mise settings ruby.compile=false` did not use precompiled binaries as of mise 2026.3. The precompiled binary feature is noted as "coming in 2026.8.0." For now, always install build dependencies (libyaml, openssl) before installing Ruby via mise.
