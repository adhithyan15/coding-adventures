## Unreleased — width-relative Venn typography

`LayoutedVennLabel.font_size` is a required resolved layout field. Generated set
and intersection labels use `48 * width / 1600`, attached labels use
`40 * width / 1600`, and paint titles use `32 * width / 1600`. Paint retains caller
weight, italic and stretch and resolves the source family/colors as before.
Checked layout also refuses nonfinite or negative label font sizes alongside
the existing coordinate checks. Width admission remains finite(0,65536]; zero
font size caused by tiny-width underflow remains supported. No source font
option, new cap, clamp, fallback or crate dependency was added.

At actual source `04712174`, the complete14-package reverse cone passed
960 tests across43 targets with zero failures/ignores, plus strict all-target
warnings/unknown-lints denial. All208 previous complete scene/query cases retain
their non-typography expectations; a narrow one-glyph adapter checks the new
font sizes and full glyph positions before reversing only the old typography.
Twenty-four additional complete scene/query cases cover three widths, two
families, titles and authored colors. Thirty-one required constructor fields
are inventoried; invalid derived fonts and width65537 still refuse.
Independent source and terminal security reviews passed.

Fixed text boxes, long/multiline fitting, real-font rendering, arbitrary forged
layout/fonts/styles and general renderer resource/visual parity remain open.
Native validation is separately attributed to `0cc8fef6`:1,824 passed/zero failed/
one unchanged archive ignore across78 targets, compiler887/fullLANG502 and
strict six-package lint. The126 focused sources produced756 actual backend
cells (696 prior exact+60new), on six available backends; absent CLR is uncounted.
Transfer uses exact166-package/2847-object inputs and21 mapped external static
resources before this documentation carrier. Named Markdown exceptions are
inventoried afterward; no dynamic/toolchain/OS closure or new native execution
is inferred. Historical Closure36/3705 plus three static inputs retains316e
attribution. Registry376 identities/checksums remain exact.

The actual hosted macOS compiler-phase proof is still OPEN. The separate
diagnostic change4ab4 preserves a bounded JSON-quoted child-output tail on
failure;13 portable tests and independent review passed. That is visibility,
not evidence of a successful Apple compiler/Cabal route. Required current-head
CI/review/conflict checks and actual merge remain delivery gates. Final-source
Miri **DEFERRED/PENDING**, never passed; frozen run/source/inputs/target/receipts
remain untouched/unpolled. Full Closure parity and output-source/full lineage
remain OPEN.
