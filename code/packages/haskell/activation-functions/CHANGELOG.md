# Changelog

## Unreleased

- `BUILD_windows` now runs `cabal test all` instead of skipping with "haskell support
  not enabled in windows CI yet", so this package is built and tested on Windows.
- The Darwin BUILD now runs Cabal with the Command Line Tools developer dir
  (`DEVELOPER_DIR=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`), so GHC 9.4.8's CLT SDK
  sysroot gets the matching linker on macOS CI with Command Line Tools 27.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-12

- Add pure Haskell implementations of six activation functions and their
  derivatives.
- Preserve the consensus overflow guards and numerically stable softplus
  behavior.
- Add reference-value, derivative, sweep, and extreme-input tests.
