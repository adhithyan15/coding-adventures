## 0.1.0 — HL02 MVP: break a script apart and write it

- **New app** (`script-writing-visualizer`): the companion "how to write it"
  surface for the Human Languages curriculum. Renders each non-Latin letter with
  its **component pieces**, a numbered **stroke order**, and a **false-friend**
  badge, for pen-and-paper practice.
- **Reads the canonical script data directly** from
  `code/learning/human-languages/data/scripts/*.json` (no copy — the app cannot
  drift from the curriculum). Ships Cyrillic, Hebrew, Chinese, Arabic, Devanagari.
- **Pure core** (`src/core.ts`) covered by unit tests, including an integration
  check against the real curriculum data (every letter has a glyph + pieces +
  stroke order; Cyrillic flags в/р/с/н as false friends).
- Framework-free vanilla-DOM UI; zero runtime dependencies.
- **Scope:** v1 is read + decompose only (no handwriting capture, no scheduler
  yet) — the first slice of the `HL02` spec.
