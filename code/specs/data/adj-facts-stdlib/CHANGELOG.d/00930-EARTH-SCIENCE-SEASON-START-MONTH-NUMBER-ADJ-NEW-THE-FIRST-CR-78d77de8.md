- `earth-science/season-start-month-number.adj` (new) — the FIRST CROSS-DIRECTORY `rule`
  composition in the ADJ stdlib's science domain (prior `rule` compositions -- word-families,
  heat-causes-phase-change, force-causes-acceleration -- all stayed within one subject directory).
  Bridges the already-shipped `season_start_month` table (`earth-science/seasons.adj`) with the
  already-shipped `month_number` table (`calendar/months.adj`) to DERIVE
  `season_start_month_number(season, number)` -- the exact bridge `seasons.adj`'s own header
  comment already invited ("the concrete bridge from RECALL to COMPUTE"). Reuses TWO
  already-verified citations (NOAA meteorological-seasons, ISO 8601 month numbering) with zero new
  sourcing work. Grounds NGSS 1-ESS1-2. This file lives in `earth-science/` (its natural home) and
  reaches its calendar sibling via a relative `../calendar/months.adj` import -- empirically
  confirmed (by reading `adj-lang-cli`'s `FsProvider` sandbox-root source directly, not just
  guessing from the error message) that this resolves cleanly because the CLI's import sandbox is
  rooted at the TOP-LEVEL PROGRAM's directory, not each importer's own directory -- so the
  companion `season-start-month-number.query.adj` is placed at the package ROOT, mirroring
  `mathematics/word-problems.query.adj`'s already-established cross-directory-import pattern. New
  manifest objective `adj.science.k2.season_start_month_number` (band K-2, `infer` competency).
  New e2e test `facts_seasonmonthnumber_e2e.rs` (3 tests: direct derivation with dual citations,
  reverse binding, honest abstention on an untabled season).
