## Unreleased

- Added this `CHANGELOG.md` (a standing gap flagged during the adj-curriculum loop's Wave 2
  literacy scoping pass, mirroring the same fix already made for `adj-formula-stdlib/`).
- `language/word-families.adj` (new) — the FIRST literacy-domain library in the ADJ stdlib.
  `word_family(word, family)` tables the "-an" word family's six core CVC (consonant-vowel-
  consonant) members (pan, fan, ran, man, tan, van), quoted verbatim from Reading Rockets'
  "Meet the Word Families." A `rule` DERIVES `rhymes_with(word1, word2)` from shared family
  membership — composing the specific family-membership fact with the general word-family
  principle ("words look alike at the end if they sound alike at the end"), the same
  rule-based-inference discipline `geometry/shape-composition.adj` already established, so
  this satisfies Wave 2's own requirement that "each tranche must include composition... not
  only direct recall" (`ADJ-STDLIB-COVERAGE.md` §7). Grounds CCSS RF.K.2.a ("Recognize and
  produce rhyming words"). Deliberately scoped to ONE family with its plain three-letter core
  members only — not the full 37-family phonics inventory, nor the longer blended/multi-
  syllable "-an" words the same source also lists (plan, scan, bran, began) — keeping this
  first slice small and citable, the same discipline every prior curriculum item in this loop
  has used. New manifest objective `adj.literacy.k2.rhyming_word_families` (the first
  literacy-domain manifest entry; also introduces the `ccss.ela` coverage root and `literacy`
  domain values, mirroring how `adj.science.clinical.bmi` introduced the first clinical-domain
  entry one PR earlier). New e2e test `facts_wordfamilies_e2e.rs` (3 tests: direct family
  recall, derived rhyme composition, honest abstention on an unshipped word).
