# IMG00 — The Raster Image Model

## Overview

A **raster image** is a finite, rectangular grid of discrete color samples called
**pixels** (picture elements). Every pixel lives at an integer coordinate (x, y)
and holds a color value. The full image is simply a 2D matrix:

```
Image(W, H) = { pixel(x, y) | 0 ≤ x < W, 0 ≤ y < H }
```

Mathematically an image is a function:

```
f : ℤ × ℤ → P
```

where **P** is the **pixel type** — the set of possible color values — and the
domain is finite: x ∈ [0, W), y ∈ [0, H).

This spec defines the data model shared by every package in the IMG series. It
answers three questions before any code is written:

1. What is the structure of a pixel? (pixel types and channel formats)
2. How are pixels arranged in memory? (layout, stride, planar vs. interleaved)
3. What coordinate conventions does this series follow?

It also provides a roadmap of the full operation taxonomy so that later specs
(IMG01–IMG07) can position themselves within the larger whole.

## Series Overview

```
IMG00  (this spec)   Image model — pixel types, colorspaces, memory layout, coordinates
IMG01               Convolution and spatial filters — Gaussian blur, edge detection, kernels
IMG02               LUTs — 1D tone curves, 3D LUT (.cube format), GPU LUT textures
IMG03               Point operations — brightness, contrast, gamma, colour matrix
IMG04               Geometric transforms — affine, perspective, scale, rotate, sampling
IMG05               Compositing — Porter-Duff operators, blend modes, alpha, layers
IMG06               GPU acceleration bridge — Rust+wgpu core, TypeScript+WebGPU, C-ABI FFI
IMG07               Morphological operations — erosion, dilation, opening, closing
```

Image I/O (encoding and decoding PNG, JPEG, BMP, QOI, PPM) is handled by the
**IC series** (IC00–IC08), which predates the IMG series. `Image`
(IC00) is the shared pixel-buffer type: every IC codec produces or consumes it,
and every IMG operation accepts and returns it. See §10 for how the two series
connect and for the `Image` evolution plan.


Specs IMG01–IMG05 define CPU-only implementations in every supported language
(Python, TypeScript, Rust, Go, Ruby, etc.). IMG06 then provides a Rust crate
that runs the same operations on the GPU and exposes a C-ABI so every language
can call it. TypeScript additionally calls the browser's native WebGPU API
directly.

## 1. Pixels and Channel Formats

A **channel** is a single numeric component of a pixel. The numeric type of a
channel determines its precision and the operations you can perform on it.

### Primitive channel types

| Type   | Width  | Range          | Typical use                          |
|--------|--------|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| u8     | 8-bit  | [0, 255]       | sRGB display, web images             |
| u16    | 16-bit | [0, 65535]     | 16-bit PNG, RAW camera files         |
| f16    | 16-bit | ≈[0.0, 65504]  | GPU textures, HDR intermediate       |
| f32    | 32-bit | ≈[−3.4×10³⁸, …]| Linear-light computation, HDR output |

The rule of thumb: **u8** for final display output (you have 8 bits of precision,
which is enough for the human eye at typical viewing conditions); **f32** for
anything involving arithmetic (blending, convolution, color-space conversions)
because rounding errors accumulate fast in repeated u8 operations.

### Pixel formats

A pixel format specifies the number of channels, their types, and their
semantics.

```
Format       Channels  Channel type  Bits/pixel  Notes
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Luma8        1         u8            8           Grayscale
LumaA8       2         u8            16          Grayscale + alpha
RGB8         3         u8            24          sRGB — the web default
RGBA8        4         u8            32          sRGB + alpha
RGB16        3         u16           48          16-bit HDR
RGBA16       4         u16           64          16-bit HDR + alpha
RGB32F       3         f32           96          Linear-light HDR
RGBA32F      4         f32           128         Linear-light HDR + alpha
```

The **alpha** channel encodes opacity: 0 = fully transparent, 255 (or 1.0) =
fully opaque. When blending two images A and B:

```
out = A.rgb * A.alpha + B.rgb * (1 - A.alpha)   (alpha pre-multiplied: A.rgb already multiplied)
out = A.rgb * A.alpha + B.rgb * (1 - A.alpha)   (straight alpha: A.rgb is not pre-multiplied)
```

Pre-multiplied alpha is preferred for compositing because blending is a single
multiply-add; straight alpha requires an extra divide on output. Most render
pipelines use pre-multiplied internally and convert at the image boundary.

---

## 2. Colorspaces

A colorspace defines what the numbers in a pixel *mean*. Two images with
identical byte patterns but different colorspace tags look different on screen.

### sRGB — the default

sRGB (IEC 61966-2-1, 1999) is the colorspace of the web, JPEG, PNG, and most
consumer cameras. It has three properties that matter for implementation:

1. **Primaries**: the CIE xy chromaticity coordinates of the red, green, and
   blue primaries. These are device-dependent (sRGB's primaries are based on
   the 1990s CRT phosphors), but are the world's most common convention.

2. **White point**: D65 (6500 K daylight), the CIE standard illuminant used for
   TV, print, and the web.

3. **Transfer function (gamma)**: sRGB uses a piecewise function that
   approximates a power curve with exponent ≈ 2.2:

```
sRGB → linear  (decode):
  if C_srgb ≤ 0.04045:
      C_linear = C_srgb / 12.92
  else:
      C_linear = ((C_srgb + 0.055) / 1.055) ^ 2.4

linear → sRGB  (encode):
  if C_linear ≤ 0.0031308:
      C_srgb = C_linear × 12.92
  else:
      C_srgb = 1.055 × C_linear^(1/2.4) − 0.055
```

The gamma curve is the single most common source of subtle image-processing
bugs. The rule is absolute: **convert to linear light before any arithmetic
(blending, convolution, scaling), then convert back to sRGB for storage or
display.**

To see why, consider blending 50% black (0) and 50% white (255) in sRGB u8:

```
sRGB blend (wrong):  (0 + 255) / 2 = 127   → perceived as darker than 50% grey
Linear blend (right):
  linear_black = 0.0
  linear_white = 1.0
  linear_mid   = 0.5
  srgb_mid     = encode_srgb(0.5) ≈ 188    → perceptually correct 50% grey
```

The difference is 127 vs 188 — a visually significant error. Every Gaussian
blur, every scale, every image composite should happen in linear light.

### Linear RGB

Same primaries and white point as sRGB, but no gamma transfer: numbers are
proportional to physical luminance. This is the correct space for:

- Gaussian blur and convolution
- Image scaling / downsampling
- Alpha blending
- Lighting and shading calculations

### HSV and HSL

HSV (Hue–Saturation–Value) and HSL (Hue–Saturation–Lightness) are cylindrical
re-parameterisations of RGB, designed to be more intuitive for artists:

```
H (hue)        ∈ [0°, 360°)   — the "color wheel" position
S (saturation) ∈ [0, 1]       — 0 = grey, 1 = fully saturated
V (value)      ∈ [0, 1]       — 0 = black, 1 = as bright as the primary allows
```

```
Color wheel — hue H:
      60°   120°
   Yellow   Green
 30°              150°
Chartreuse       Cyan-green

0°  Red                Cyan  180°

300°            210°
Magenta       Blue-green
     240°  300°
      Blue  Violet
```

HSV is useful for color pickers and color-range selection (e.g., "select all
orange pixels"). It is not suitable for blending or convolution — convert to
linear RGB first.

Conversion (HSV → RGB, for H ∈ [0°, 360°), S,V ∈ [0,1]):

```
C = V × S                 (chroma)
X = C × (1 − |H/60° mod 2 − 1|)
m = V − C

       H in [0°,60°):  (R',G',B') = (C, X, 0)
       H in [60°,120°): (R',G',B') = (X, C, 0)
       H in [120°,180°):(R',G',B') = (0, C, X)
       H in [180°,240°):(R',G',B') = (0, X, C)
       H in [240°,300°):(R',G',B') = (X, 0, C)
       H in [300°,360°):(R',G',B') = (C, 0, X)

(R, G, B) = (R'+m, G'+m, B'+m)
```

### CIE L*a*b* (CIELAB)

CIELAB (CIE 1976) is a **perceptually uniform** colorspace: equal numeric
distances correspond to equal perceived color differences for an average human
observer under a specified viewing condition.

```
L* ∈ [0, 100]       — lightness: 0 = black, 100 = diffuse white
a* ∈ [−128, 127]    — green (−) to red (+) opponent axis
b* ∈ [−128, 127]    — blue (−) to yellow (+) opponent axis
```

The principal use of CIELAB is **color difference measurement**:

```
ΔE₇₆ = √(ΔL*² + Δa*² + Δb*²)
```

A ΔE of 1 is approximately the just-noticeable difference (JND) for an average
observer. ΔE < 2 is considered acceptable for print; ΔE < 1 for critical
colour-matching work.

Conversion goes through XYZ (not reproduced in full here; see IMG03).

### Oklab (Björn Ottosson, 2020)

Oklab is a modern perceptually uniform colorspace with two advantages over
CIELAB:

1. **Better hue linearity**: hues do not shift when you interpolate or increase
   saturation. A gradient from blue to red through Oklab stays vivid in the
   middle; through HSV or sRGB it often turns muddy grey.
2. **Simpler derivation**: a direct matrix + per-channel cube root, no
   discontinuous cases.

```
L ∈ [0, 1]     — lightness
a ∈ [−0.5, 0.5] — approx. green–red
b ∈ [−0.5, 0.5] — approx. blue–yellow
```

Preferred over CIELAB for color interpolation, gradient generation, and palette
manipulation.

### YCbCr

YCbCr separates **luma** (Y, the brightness signal) from two **chroma**
channels (Cb = blue-difference, Cr = red-difference). It is the native
colorspace of JPEG, H.264, and H.265.

```
Y  ∈ [0, 1]          — luma (weighted average of linear R, G, B)
Cb ∈ [−0.5, 0.5]     — blue-difference chroma
Cr ∈ [−0.5, 0.5]     — red-difference chroma
```

The reason YCbCr dominates video codecs: human vision is far more sensitive to
luma detail than to chroma detail. So chroma can be **subsampled** — stored at
half or quarter resolution — without visible quality loss. The most common
scheme is **4:2:0**: luma at full resolution, both chroma channels at half
horizontal and half vertical resolution. This saves roughly 50% bandwidth.

## 3. Memory Layout

The pixel type tells us what one pixel looks like. The memory layout tells us
how an entire image is arranged as a flat byte buffer.

### Dimensions and stride

```
Field      Symbol  Description
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
width        W     number of columns (x direction)
height       H     number of rows (y direction)
channels     C     components per pixel (1 for Luma, 3 for RGB, 4 for RGBA)
bit depth    D     bits per channel (8, 16, or 32)
stride       S     bytes from start of row i to start of row i+1
```

The minimum possible stride (tightly packed) is:

```
S_min = W × C × (D / 8)
```

Most libraries pad rows to a multiple of 4 or 16 bytes for SIMD alignment. The
extra bytes are called **row padding** and must not be interpreted as pixel
data.

```
Row y = 0: [pixel(0,0)][pixel(1,0)]...[pixel(W-1,0)][padding]
Row y = 1: [pixel(0,1)][pixel(1,1)]...[pixel(W-1,1)][padding]
...
Row y = H-1: [pixel(0,H-1)]...[pixel(W-1,H-1)][padding]
```

Byte offset of pixel (x, y):

```
offset(x, y) = y × S + x × bytes_per_pixel
             = y × S + x × C × (D / 8)
```

### Interleaved layout (packed)

All channels of one pixel are stored together:

```
RGBA8 (interleaved):
  R₀ G₀ B₀ A₀  R₁ G₁ B₁ A₁  R₂ G₂ B₂ A₂  ...
  ◄── pixel 0 ──►◄── pixel 1 ──►◄── pixel 2 ──►
```

This is the default for this series. Advantages:

- Cache-friendly when processing one pixel at a time (all channels adjacent)
- The format expected by OpenGL, Metal, WebGPU textures
- The format produced by PNG, JPEG, and BMP decoders

### Planar layout

All values of one channel are grouped together:

```
RGB planar (3 separate planes):
  plane R: R₀ R₁ R₂ R₃ ... R_{W×H-1}
  plane G: G₀ G₁ G₂ G₃ ... G_{W×H-1}
  plane B: B₀ B₁ B₂ B₃ ... B_{W×H-1}
```

Advantages:

- Excellent for SIMD: load 16 consecutive red values in a single AVX2 load
- Used by many video codecs for YCbCr data
- Allows different subsampling per channel (4:2:0)

The GPU acceleration layer (IMG06) accepts both layouts via a layout descriptor
passed to the shader. CPU code in this series defaults to interleaved.

### Byte order for multi-byte channels

For u16 and f32 channels, the byte order of the host CPU matters:

- x86, ARM (LE mode): **little-endian** — least-significant byte at the lower address
- Network byte order, most file formats: **big-endian** — most-significant byte first

16-bit PNG uses big-endian u16. A little-endian CPU must byte-swap when reading:

```
u16 from big-endian bytes [hi, lo]:
  value = (uint16_t)hi << 8 | lo

u16 from little-endian bytes [lo, hi]:
  value = lo | (uint16_t)hi << 8
```

f32 values are almost always stored in the native endianness of the host
machine. File formats that store f32 (e.g., OpenEXR) specify endianness in
their header.

---

## 4. Coordinate System

This series uses the **raster coordinate system** throughout:

```
(0,0) ─────────────────── x ────────────────► (W-1, 0)
  │
  │    (0,0) is the TOP-LEFT corner of the top-left pixel.
  │
  y    x increases to the RIGHT  (column index).
  │    y increases DOWNWARD      (row index).
  │
  ▼
(0, H-1)                               (W-1, H-1)
```

This convention matches PNG, JPEG, BMP, HTML Canvas, Metal, DirectX, and
WebGPU. It is the opposite of the mathematical Cartesian convention (y-up) used
by OpenGL and PDF. A y-flip is one of the most common pitfalls when mixing
rendering APIs.

### Sub-pixel coordinates

Geometric transforms (IMG04) and image sampling operate at sub-pixel precision.
A sub-pixel coordinate (u, v) where u ∈ ℝ refers to a position *within* the
image. The conversion between sub-pixel coordinates and integer pixel indices
depends on the **sample model**:

- **Pixel-centre model** (used by this series): integer (i, j) refers to the
  centre of pixel (i, j). The pixel occupies the square [i−0.5, i+0.5) ×
  [j−0.5, j+0.5). To sample at (u, v) bilinearly, take the four nearest
  integer centres.

- **Pixel-corner model** (used by some OpenGL code): integer (i, j) refers to
  the top-left corner of pixel (i, j). This shifts all sample positions by
  (0.5, 0.5) relative to the pixel-centre model.

Mixing the two models is a common half-pixel alignment bug. This series always
uses the pixel-centre model.

---

## 5. Categories of Image Operations

Every image operation takes one or more images as input, applies a
transformation, and produces one or more images as output. The categories below
partition the operation space by **locality** — how far from the current pixel
each output sample depends.

### 5.1 Point operations (zero neighbourhood)

Each output pixel depends only on the corresponding input pixel. The operation
is a pure function P → P applied independently at every (x, y).

```
O(x, y) = f( I(x, y) )
```

The work is trivially parallelisable: no data dependencies between pixels.
Modern CPUs process 16–32 u8 pixels per clock with SIMD; GPUs process millions
per microsecond.

**Examples**:

| Operation           | Mapping                                                     |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Invert              | O = 255 − I  (u8 domain)                                   |
| Brightness +Δ       | O = clamp(I + Δ, 0, 255)                                   |
| Contrast ×k         | O = clamp((I − 128) × k + 128, 0, 255)                     |
| Gamma γ             | O = (I / 255)^γ × 255                                       |
| sRGB → linear       | piecewise function (see §2)                                 |
| Threshold at t      | O = 255 if I ≥ t else 0                                     |
| Channel swap        | O.R = I.B; O.G = I.G; O.B = I.R                            |
| Colour matrix       | [O.R,O.G,O.B]ᵀ = M × [I.R,I.G,I.B]ᵀ (3×3 or 4×4 matrix)  |

Point operations are specified fully in IMG03.

### 5.2 Geometric transforms (coordinate remapping)

The output image is formed by mapping each output coordinate (x', y') back to a
source coordinate (u, v) and sampling the input image there. Because (u, v) is
generally non-integer, **interpolation** is required.

```
(u, v) = T⁻¹(x', y')          (inverse warp)
O(x', y') = sample( I, u, v )  (bilinear, bicubic, …)
```

**Examples**:

| Transform          | T(x, y)                                            |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Flip horizontal    | (W−1−x, y)                                         |
| Flip vertical      | (x, H−1−y)                                         |
| 90° rotation (CW)  | (y, W−1−x)                                         |
| Scale by (sx, sy)  | (x/sx, y/sy)                                       |
| Affine warp        | M × [x, y, 1]ᵀ  where M is a 2×3 matrix           |
| Perspective warp   | homogeneous divide: M × [x, y, 1]ᵀ / w             |

Geometric transforms are specified fully in IMG04.

### 5.3 Spatial filters (neighbourhood operations)

Each output pixel depends on a rectangular **neighbourhood** of input pixels,
combined using a small weight matrix called the **kernel**. This is the costliest
operation family and the subject of IMG01.

```
O(x, y) = Σᵢ Σⱼ  K(i, j) × I(x+i, y+j)
```

**Examples**:

| Filter              | What the kernel measures / applies                          |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Box blur            | Uniform average of the neighbourhood                        |
| Gaussian blur       | Weighted average, weights fall off as a Gaussian            |
| Sobel horizontal    | Approximates ∂I/∂x — detects vertical edges                |
| Sobel vertical      | Approximates ∂I/∂y — detects horizontal edges              |
| Laplacian           | Approximates ∇²I — highlights regions of rapid change      |
| Sharpen             | Center minus Laplacian: accentuates edges                   |
| Unsharp mask        | I + k × (I − blur(I)) — selective sharpening               |
| Emboss              | Directional edge with lighting bias                         |

### 5.4 LUTs and colour transforms (structured point operations)

A special class of point operations where the mapping P → P is stored as a
precomputed table rather than evaluated algebraically. The table can encode
transformations too complex for a closed-form formula.

- **1D LUT**: one table per channel; maps each channel value independently.
  Stores arbitrary tone curves.
- **3D LUT**: one N×N×N colour cube; maps an (R,G,B) triple to a new (R',G',B').
  Stores arbitrary colour grades, ICC profile approximations, film looks.

LUTs are the subject of IMG02.

### 5.5 Frequency-domain operations (global operations)

These decompose the entire image into spatial-frequency components via the
2D Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), operate in frequency space, then
reconstruct.

```
F = DFT(I)          — W×H complex values, each a spatial frequency component
F' = op(F)          — e.g., multiply by a Gaussian to low-pass filter
O = IDFT(F')        — inverse transform back to spatial domain
```

Because the DFT is global, a single operation touches every pixel in the output.
This makes frequency-domain operations expensive to compose but extremely
powerful: a Gaussian blur via the DFT has O(WH log(WH)) cost compared to
O(WHr²) for a direct spatial convolution — advantageous for very large kernels.

This series does not implement full DFT-based filtering in the initial set of
specs, but it is named here so that IMG01 (convolution) can explain when the
spatial vs frequency tradeoff tips.

## 6. `Image` as the Base Type

### The existing type (IC00)

`Image` (defined in IC00, implemented in every language in the repo)
is the concrete pixel-buffer type for this entire series. It was introduced as
the interchange format for image codecs, but its design is general enough to
serve as the foundation for all image processing operations.

> **Note on naming**: the current code calls this type `PixelContainer`. The
> specs use `Image` throughout, reflecting the planned rename. The code rename
> will happen in a separate wave; until then, `Image` in any spec means the
> type currently called `PixelContainer` in the implementation.

```
Image {
    width:  u32       // image width in pixels
    height: u32       // image height in pixels
    data:   [u8]      // RGBA8, row-major, top-left, stride = width × 4 (tightly packed)
}

offset(x, y) = (y * width + x) * 4
data[offset + 0] = R   (sRGB u8)
data[offset + 1] = G
data[offset + 2] = B
data[offset + 3] = A   (straight alpha u8)
```

Every IC codec (PNG, JPEG, BMP, QOI, PPM) speaks this format. Every language
in the repo already has an `Image` implementation. The IMG operations
in IMG01–IMG05 accept and return `Image` directly.

### The limitation: RGBA8 only

The current `Image` is fixed at RGBA8 (unsigned byte, sRGB). This
covers the I/O and display use case well but is too restrictive for a full
image-processing pipeline:

- Convolution and compositing require **f32 working buffers** (linear light,
  no clamping during accumulation — see §7).
- HDR images need **u16 or f32** channel precision.
- Grayscale processing (edge detection, masks) works on **single-channel**
  data; forcing three-channel RGBA wastes memory and bandwidth.
- Zero-copy `crop` requires an explicit **stride** field (currently absent).

### The evolution: extended `Image`

The plan is to evolve `Image` by adding three metadata fields while
keeping the existing API fully backward-compatible. The IC codec series does
not need to change; codecs continue to construct the existing `{width, height,
data}` form, which is now understood as the default case:
`format = RGBA8, colorspace = SRGB, stride = width × 4`.

```
// Extended Image (IC00 v2 proposal)
Image {
    width:      u32
    height:     u32
    stride:     u32          // bytes per row; default = width × bytes_per_pixel(format)
    format:     PixelFormat  // which pixel type the bytes encode
    colorspace: Colorspace   // how to interpret colour values
    data:       [u8]         // raw bytes; interpretation depends on format
}

enum PixelFormat {
    Luma8,              // 1 channel, u8
    LumaA8,             // 2 channels, u8
    RGB8,               // 3 channels, u8
    RGBA8,              // 4 channels, u8   ← existing default
    RGB16,              // 3 channels, u16 little-endian
    RGBA16,             // 4 channels, u16 little-endian
    RGB32F,             // 3 channels, f32 native-endian
    RGBA32F,            // 4 channels, f32 native-endian
}

enum Colorspace {
    SRGB,               // standard sRGB with gamma transfer function ← existing default
    LINEAR,             // linear light, same primaries as sRGB
    UNSPECIFIED,        // unknown; treat as SRGB for display, linear for processing
}
```

The stride field enables **zero-copy crop**: a cropped container shares the
parent's data buffer with `stride = parent.stride` and an offset into `data`.
The crop operation does not need to copy bytes.

**Backward compatibility**: every existing `Image` constructor
continues to work unchanged. The `format` field defaults to `RGBA8`. The
`colorspace` field defaults to `SRGB`. The `stride` field defaults to
`width × 4`. Code that reads `container.data` directly still works because
the byte layout is unchanged for the default case.

**Migration path for IMG operations**: the IMG packages use the extended
`Image` internally for their f32 working buffers (format `RGBA32F`,
colorspace `LINEAR`) and accept/return the public `RGBA8/SRGB` form at the
API boundary. The sRGB↔linear conversion is always done at the input and
output edges, never inside an operation.

The extended `Image` specification and migration guide will be
formalised in IC00 v2. The IMG specs reference it now so that implementors
can design with the full picture in mind.

## 7. Precision and Overflow

Before implementing any operation, pin down the arithmetic precision rules:

### Rule 1: work in the precision of the output

If the output format is f32, do all intermediate arithmetic in f32. If the
output is u8, intermediate results may temporarily exceed [0, 255] (e.g., a
convolution sum) and must be **clamped** before storing.

### Rule 2: clamp, do not wrap

u8 overflow must clamp to [0, 255], not wrap around modulo 256. A brightness
increase that pushes 200 to 320 should produce 255, not 64 (320 mod 256).
Wrapping produces vivid but wrong colour artefacts. Language-specific notes:

- Rust: use `u8::saturating_add` / `saturating_sub`, or cast via f32.
- C/C++: unsigned arithmetic wraps (defined behaviour); add explicit clamp.
- Python: integers do not overflow; cast to float, clamp, then cast back.

### Rule 3: accumulate convolutions in f32 or f64

A 5×5 kernel times a u8 image accumulates up to 25 products. Each product ≤
255 × 1.0 (normalised kernel) ≤ 255. The sum ≤ 255. But intermediate values
during accumulation can reach 25 × 255 = 6375, which overflows u8 and i16.
Always accumulate convolution sums in f32 (or i32 for integer kernels), then
clamp to the output range.

## 8. Relationship to the Paint Stack

The image model defined here is independent of the PaintVM (P2D) stack used for
vector graphics and text rendering. The two meet at **raster compositing**:

```
PaintVM emits PaintScene instructions
    │
    ▼  PaintRasterizer (P2D05, P2D06)
    │  converts vector + text → pixel buffer
    │
    ▼  Image<RGBA8>          ← this series
    │
    ▼  Display / export pipeline
```

A `PaintGlyphRun` or `PaintFillPath` instruction eventually writes pixels into
an `Image` (RGBA8). The image processing operations in this series
(blur, LUTs, transforms, compositing) can be applied to that buffer before
final display.

---

## 10. The IC / IMG Relationship

The **IC series** (IC00–IC08) owns the codec layer: encoding and decoding
pixel data to/from file formats (PNG, JPEG, BMP, QOI, PPM, etc.). IC00 defines
`Image` and `ImageCodec`. IC01–IC08 implement specific codecs.

The **IMG series** (this spec, IMG01–IMG07) owns the processing layer:
transforming pixel data in memory. Every IMG operation accepts and returns
`Image`.

```
File on disk
    │
    ▼  IC codec (IC01–IC08)
Image (RGBA8, sRGB)
    │
    ▼  IMG processing (IMG01–IMG07)
Image (RGBA8, sRGB)   ← or RGBA32F/LINEAR internally during processing
    │
    ▼  IC codec (IC01–IC08)
File on disk (or display surface)
```

The two series are deliberately decoupled: IC knows nothing about blur or
LUTs; IMG knows nothing about PNG headers or JPEG quantisation tables. The
only shared contract is `Image`.

### Colorspace at the boundary

IC codecs produce sRGB-encoded RGBA8 (PNG, JPEG) or unspecified (BMP, PPM).
The `colorspace` field on the extended `Image` (§6) carries this
information across the boundary so IMG operations can perform the correct
sRGB→linear conversion at their input edge.

```
// Typical round-trip with colorspace tracking:
let mut pc = png_codec.decode(file_bytes);         // colorspace = SRGB
pc = gaussian_blur(&pc, sigma=2.0, ...);           // internally converts to linear
pc = apply_lut3d(&pc, &film_look_lut);             // internally converts to linear
let output = jpeg_codec.encode(&pc);               // expects SRGB; pc still tagged SRGB
```
