# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Accept zero-argument `console.log()` through the typed JavaScript AST and
  Rust VM builtin, appending exactly one newline without a numeric operand.
  Preserve that completed newline if a later accepted VM operation fails.
- Preserve completed JavaScript console output when a later VM instruction fails.

## 0.1.0

- Add a bounded direct JavaScript AST to IIR compiler and native VM runner.
- Bound source loading, typed AST lowering, and console output before allocation.
