### Changed — corpus pins moved by the new track, never weakened

Adding a 21st track necessarily moves whole-corpus measurements. Every pin below
was updated with a comment naming this change as the cause; none was relaxed.

- `integration.test.ts`: registered tracks, authored books, schema tracks and book
  coverage 20 → 21; compiled activity ids 51 → 57. Duration violations and unknown
  prerequisites remain **0**.
- `cli.test.ts`: reported `registeredTracks` 20 → 21.
- `modality-manifest.test.ts`: total lessons 1,118 → 1,125; `voice` 719 → 724;
  `sight` 346 → 348; `trackCount` 20 → 21; `chapterCount` 375 → 376;
  `drivablePrefixTotal` 557 → 558. The `pen` count (53) and the corpus-wide drivable
  share (64%) are unchanged, because no Chinese lesson needs a pen and none carries a
  table. The two `sight` lessons are `ZH-C01-ni` and `ZH-C01-hao`, which each teach a
  character's components in a `script` block.
- **No `modality.test.ts` edit, and no Language Ladder test edit.** Both used to hold
  hard-coded track and corpus counts and were rewritten upstream to derive them —
  `modality.test.ts` now asserts size-independent invariants, and the Language Ladder
  suites read `LANGUAGE_ORDER.length` / `LANGUAGE_CHAIN.length` instead of the literal
  20. Registering a track no longer requires touching any of them, which is why this
  entry is shorter than the same entry would have been a week ago.
