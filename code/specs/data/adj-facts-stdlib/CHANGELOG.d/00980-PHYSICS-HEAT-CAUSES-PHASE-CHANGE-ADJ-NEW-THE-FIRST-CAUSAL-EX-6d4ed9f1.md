- `physics/heat-causes-phase-change.adj` (new) — the FIRST causal-explanation library in the
  ADJ stdlib's science domain (ADJ-STDLIB-COVERAGE.md §5.1's Science row names "causal
  explanations" as a Major Gap). A new `heat_direction(change, direction)` table names which
  of the four everyday phase changes heat flows IN for (`heating`) and which it flows OUT for
  (`cooling`), quoted verbatim from the SAME LibreTexts page the sibling `states-of-matter.adj`
  already cites. A `rule` DERIVES `causes_phase_change(direction, name)` by composing this new
  table with the ALREADY-SHIPPED `phase_change_name` table from that sibling library — a
  genuine CROSS-FILE composition (not just within one file, like `word-families.adj`), proving
  the stdlib's own stated goal that "an AI agent working in a domain can reason through this
  library the way a student reasons up from foundations." Grounds NGSS 2-PS1-4. Deliberately
  scoped to the four transitions the cited sentence names directly (melting, freezing,
  vaporization, condensation) — NOT sublimation or deposition, which the same source describes
  only by temperature/pressure condition, not a parallel heat-direction sentence, so asserting
  a row for either would outrun what is actually cited. New manifest objective
  `adj.science.k2.heat_causes_phase_change` (band K-2, matching NGSS 2-PS1-4's own grade level;
  uses the `infer` competency for a `rule`-derived fact, mirroring
  `adj.math.k2.spatial_composition`'s precedent). New e2e test `facts_heatphasechange_e2e.rs`
  (2 tests).
