## Unreleased — reviewed Venn debug geometry and set defaults

Debug layout groups exact ordered set vectors, including embedded NULs, in first
authored order. Preparation indexes preserve last-ID centers, first-ID radii and
any nonempty matching region label. Checked layout validates finite debug
positions and finite nonnegative radii/cell dimensions alongside every previous
numeric guard. Actual scan-visit tests cover 8/32/128 groups without a new cap.

Unstyled sets use opacity 0.1, resolved raw fill as stroke, and stroke width
`5 * width / 1600`. Authored opacity, stroke and width override independently,
including zero; an empty typed palette retains the blue fallback. Paint consumes
explicit debug vectors even when the typed debug flag is false.

Tested source `58a7862f`: 943 tests passed, zero failures/ignores, 41 targets;
strict all-target Clippy passed for all 14 affected packages. The 176 complete
scene/query cases retain 104 earlier oracles through a checked reversible
default adapter and add 56 typed plus 16 parsed-source cases. This establishes
the bounded contracts, not full Mermaid rendering or Closure parity. Required
hosted acceptance remains pending; final-source Miri **DEFERRED/PENDING**.
