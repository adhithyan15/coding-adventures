# Changelog

## Unreleased — reviewed Venn debug geometry and set defaults

Debug layout groups exact ordered set vectors, including embedded NULs, in first
authored order. Preparation indexes preserve last-ID centers, first-ID radii and
any nonempty matching region label. Checked layout validates finite debug
positions and finite nonnegative radii/cell dimensions alongside every previous
numeric guard. Actual scan-visit tests cover 8/32/128 groups without a new cap.

Unstyled sets use opacity 0.1, resolved raw fill as stroke, and stroke width
`5 * width / 1600`. Authored opacity, stroke and width override independently,
including zero; an empty typed palette retains the blue fallback. Paint consumes
explicit debug vectors even when the typed debug flag is false.

Tested source `58a7862f`: 943 tests passed, zero failures/ignores, 41 targets;
strict all-target Clippy passed for all 14 affected packages. The 176 complete
scene/query cases retain 104 earlier oracles through a checked reversible
default adapter and add 56 typed plus 16 parsed-source cases. This establishes
the bounded contracts, not full Mermaid rendering or Closure parity. Required
hosted acceptance remains pending; final-source Miri **DEFERRED/PENDING**.

## Unreleased — preserve bounded Venn palette transport

Transport all eight independently sanitized source palette slots through typed
config and checked layout into ordered circle fills and complete scene metadata.
Preserve scoped source-origin/quote guards, numeric/geometry limits, authored-fill
precedence and arbitrary/empty typed palette semantics. Verify104 whole-scene
cells,932 affected tests/41targets, strict lint and independent source/terminal
reviews. Physical/full-style parity, hosted acceptance and publication remain
separate. Final-source Miri **DEFERRED/PENDING**, never passed.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-04-24

### Added
- Initial release as part of DG04 extended diagram families
- `layout_geometric_diagram(diagram)` — resolve canvas size for geometric diagrams
- Auto-size from element bounding boxes (Box, Circle, Line, Arc, Text)
- Respects explicit `width`/`height` overrides (partial or both)
- 7 unit tests

## Unreleased — bounded Venn canvas configuration

Preserve incoming canvas config and portable metadata while bounding source
scalars and adding a checked typed layout API. Recognize only direct config
members in closed single-line init objects; preserve whole-object front-matter
precedence and field defaults. Keep original supported geometry and every
unrelated production/test path. Add exact geometry and complete scene/query
controls; final affected 14-package strict lint and 918 unfiltered tests pass.
Final-source Miri DEFERRED/PENDING; hosted checks/merge/full parity remain OPEN.

## Unreleased — width-relative Venn typography

`LayoutedVennLabel.font_size` is a required resolved layout field. Generated set
and intersection labels use `48 * width / 1600`, attached labels use
`40 * width / 1600`, and paint titles use `32 * width / 1600`. Paint retains caller
weight, italic and stretch and resolves the source family/colors as before.
Checked layout also refuses nonfinite or negative label font sizes alongside
the existing coordinate checks. Width admission remains finite(0,65536]; zero
font size caused by tiny-width underflow remains supported. No source font
option, new cap, clamp, fallback or crate dependency was added.

At actual source `04712174`, the complete14-package reverse cone passed
960 tests across43 targets with zero failures/ignores, plus strict all-target
warnings/unknown-lints denial. All208 previous complete scene/query cases retain
their non-typography expectations; a narrow one-glyph adapter checks the new
font sizes and full glyph positions before reversing only the old typography.
Twenty-four additional complete scene/query cases cover three widths, two
families, titles and authored colors. Thirty-one required constructor fields
are inventoried; invalid derived fonts and width65537 still refuse.
Independent source and terminal security reviews passed.

Fixed text boxes, long/multiline fitting, real-font rendering, arbitrary forged
layout/fonts/styles and general renderer resource/visual parity remain open.
Native validation is separately attributed to `0cc8fef6`:1,824 passed/zero failed/
one unchanged archive ignore across78 targets, compiler887/fullLANG502 and
strict six-package lint. The126 focused sources produced756 actual backend
cells (696 prior exact+60new), on six available backends; absent CLR is uncounted.
Transfer uses exact166-package/2847-object inputs and21 mapped external static
resources before this documentation carrier. Named Markdown exceptions are
inventoried afterward; no dynamic/toolchain/OS closure or new native execution
is inferred. Historical Closure36/3705 plus three static inputs retains316e
attribution. Registry376 identities/checksums remain exact.

The actual hosted macOS compiler-phase proof is still OPEN. The separate
diagnostic change4ab4 preserves a bounded JSON-quoted child-output tail on
failure;13 portable tests and independent review passed. That is visibility,
not evidence of a successful Apple compiler/Cabal route. Required current-head
CI/review/conflict checks and actual merge remain delivery gates. Final-source
Miri **DEFERRED/PENDING**, never passed; frozen run/source/inputs/target/receipts
remain untouched/unpolled. Full Closure parity and output-source/full lineage
remain OPEN.
