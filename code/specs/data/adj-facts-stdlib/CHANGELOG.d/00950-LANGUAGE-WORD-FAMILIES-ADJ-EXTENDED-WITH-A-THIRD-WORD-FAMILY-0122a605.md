- `language/word-families.adj` — extended with a THIRD word family, "-ig" (big, pig, fig, dig,
  wig), added as five new rows in the existing `word_family` table alongside "-an" and "-at". The
  existing `rhymes_with` rule is again reused UNCHANGED. Quoted verbatim from a THIRD source, Super
  Teacher Worksheets (a widely-used K-5 phonics teaching-resource site, `trust consensus`, same
  tier as the other two): "Words include: big, pig, fig, dig, wig and twig." — WebFetch-verified
  twice for consistency before writing. Deliberately excludes "twig" (a four-letter
  consonant-blend word) to preserve the strict three-letter CVC scope, the same discipline "-an"
  and "-at" already established. No new manifest objective needed — extends the same
  already-covered library `adj.literacy.k2.rhyming_word_families`. New e2e test
  `rhymes_with_isolates_a_third_family_and_abstains_on_the_excluded_blend_word` (5th test in
  `facts_wordfamilies_e2e.rs`), which asserts NO cross-contamination with either prior family AND
  honest abstention on "twig".
