- `language/initial-sound.adj` (new) -- the THIRD literacy sub-skill library in the ADJ stdlib,
  deliberately different in shape from both prior ones: `word-families.adj` derives RHYMING
  (RF.K.2.a, shared END sound) via a `rule`, `syllable-count.adj` recalls a SYLLABLE COUNT
  (RF.K.2.b) -- this one recalls a word's BEGINNING sound (phoneme identity/isolation, RF.K.2.d)
  as a pure lookup, `initial_sound(word, sound)`. Quoted verbatim from Reading Rockets' "Reading
  101 for Parents: Phonological and Phonemic Awareness" guide, WebFetch-verified TWICE for
  consistency before writing: "Bell, bike, and boy all have /b/ at the beginning." -- the site's
  own canonical phoneme-identity example (confirmed appearing word-for-word on more than one
  Reading Rockets page). Deliberately scoped to ONLY the three words and one sound (/b/) this
  single cited sentence names -- all three happen to share one phoneme, so the table is honestly
  narrow (mirroring `syllable-count.adj`'s all-2-syllable table) rather than fabricating a second
  sound group from an uncited word list. Grounds CCSS RF.K.2.d. New manifest objective
  `adj.literacy.k2.initial_sound` (band K-2, `recall` competency). New e2e test
  `facts_initialsound_e2e.rs` (3 tests: direct recall, reverse binding across all three words
  sharing /b/, honest abstention on an unshipped word).
