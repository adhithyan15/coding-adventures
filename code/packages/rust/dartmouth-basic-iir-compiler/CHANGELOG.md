# Changelog — `dartmouth-basic-iir-compiler`

## 0.2.0 — 2026-05-26 (PL05-B — real BasicCirJit backend)

### Added — `BasicCirJit`: a real `jit_core::backend::Backend`

Ships a real bytecode JIT for Dartmouth BASIC, modelled on Brainfuck's
`BrainfuckCirJit` pattern.  Translates the specialised CIR instruction
stream (`const_i64`, `add_i64`, `cmp_*_i64`, `jmp`, `jmp_if_false`,
`call_builtin "print_i64"`, `ret_void`) into a packed register-machine
bytecode and interprets it in a tight match-loop — bypassing
`vm-core`'s generic IIR dispatch entirely.

Same "classic JIT" shape used by the JVM Ignition tier, Smalltalk-80,
Lua, and V8 Ignition.  Not a native-code JIT (Cranelift / x86_64) —
swapping in a native backend later is the only change needed.

#### Bytecode opcodes

22 opcodes covering BASIC's full V1 vocabulary:
- Constants: `CONST_I64` (8-byte little-endian payload)
- Arithmetic: `ADD_I64` / `SUB_I64` / `MUL_I64` / `DIV_I64` / `NEG_I64`
- Comparisons: `CMP_EQ_I64` / `CMP_NE_I64` / `CMP_LT_I64` / `CMP_LE_I64`
  / `CMP_GT_I64` / `CMP_GE_I64`
- Control flow: `JMP` / `JMP_IF_FALSE` / `JMP_IF_TRUE` (i16 LE offsets)
- Builtins: `PRINT_I64` / `INPUT_I64`
- Returns: `RET_I64` / `RET_VOID`
- Plus `MOV` for register-to-register copy

Register file: 256 i64 registers, single-byte indices.

#### Shared I/O via Arc<Mutex<…>>

`BasicCirJit::new` takes `Arc<Mutex<Vec<i64>>>` (output),
`Arc<Mutex<VecDeque<i64>>>` (input), `Arc<Mutex<u64>>` (step counter),
and `Arc<Mutex<Option<String>>>` (error slot).  The same Arc handles
can be shared with `VMCore`'s `print_i64` / `input_i64` builtin
registrations, so interpreter-fallback and JIT-compiled paths see the
same logical streams.

#### `main.type_status = FullyTyped` override

BASIC's IIR uses `"void"` type hints on control-flow ops (`label`,
`jmp`, `ret`, `call_builtin "print_i64"`).  `"void"` is **not** in
`interpreter_ir::opcodes::CONCRETE_TYPES`, so `IIRFunction::new`'s
automatic `infer_type_status` returns `PartiallyTyped`.  Without an
explicit override, `jit-core`'s threshold-zero compile path (which
requires `FullyTyped`) would never fire.

The fix mirrors Brainfuck's compiler: after `IIRFunction::new`, set
`main.type_status = FunctionTypeStatus::FullyTyped`.  Every BASIC
instruction is in fact statically known (no `"any"` hints anywhere),
so the override is semantically correct.

#### Tests

- 5 unit tests in `jit_backend::tests` cover compile + run paths for
  CONST_I64 / RET_I64, PRINT_I64, ADD_I64, unknown-opcode rejection,
  and division-by-zero error reporting.
- 6 end-to-end integration tests in `tests/jit_real_backend.rs` run
  full BASIC programs through `JITCore` with `BasicCirJit` as the
  backend (instead of `NullBackend`).  Covers PRINT, LET +
  arithmetic, FOR loops, IF/GOTO branches, multiplication, and
  accumulating FOR with arithmetic in the body.

### Changed

- `jit-core` and `vm-core` promoted from dev-dependencies to main
  dependencies — `BasicCirJit` lives in this crate's `src/`, not its
  `tests/`.
- `jit_backend` module re-exported from `lib.rs`; `BasicCirJit`,
  `DEFAULT_OUTPUT_CAP`, and `DEFAULT_STEP_CAP` are part of the public
  API.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-05-20 (PL05 initial release)

Initial release.  Compiles Dartmouth BASIC source to
`interpreter_ir::IIRModule`, unlocking the LANG VM AOT chain
(twig-aot / lang-aot → x86_64-backend / aarch64-backend → object →
system linker → native executable) for BASIC programs.

Distinct from the existing `dartmouth-basic-ir-compiler` crate, which
targets the GE-225 simulator's custom `compiler_ir::IrProgram` shape
and is not pluggable into the LANG VM chain.

### V1 coverage (integer programs)

| Statement | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| `LET A = expr` | ✓ |
| `PRINT expr`   | ✓ (numeric only — strings deferred to LANG77) |
| `INPUT X`      | ✓ |
| `IF cond THEN m` | ✓ |
| `GOTO m`       | ✓ |
| `FOR I = a TO b STEP s` / `NEXT I` | ✓ (positive STEP) |
| `END` / `STOP` | ✓ |
| `REM …`        | ✓ (no-op) |
| `GOSUB` / `RETURN` | **deferred** — V1 errors with `UnsupportedStatement` |
| `READ` / `DATA` / `RESTORE` | deferred — needs data pool |
| `DIM` / arrays | deferred — needs LANG76-based byte arrays |
| `DEF`          | deferred |

### Expression coverage

- Integer literals (floats truncate to i64; explicit float support
  deferred until backends grow SSE2).
- Variables (scalar `A..Z`, `A0..Z9` — array access `A(I)` deferred).
- Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` with standard precedence.
- Unary minus.
- Exponentiation (`^`): deferred — needs a runtime helper.
- Built-in / user-defined functions (`SIN`, `FNA`, …): deferred.

### IIR shape

The whole program becomes a single function `main` returning `i64`.
Every BASIC line gets a label `line_<n>`; flow-control statements
jump between those labels.  FOR/NEXT loops use per-loop synthetic
labels `for_<id>_test` / `for_<id>_end`.

### Tests

11 unit tests cover each supported statement plus the deferred
`UnsupportedStatement` paths.  End-to-end smoke tests in
`lang-aot/tests/end_to_end_smoke.rs` compile BASIC programs all the
way to native executables on Windows + Linux and assert stdout:

- `10 PRINT 42 / 20 END` → stdout `"42\n"`.
- `10 FOR I = 1 TO 3 / 20 PRINT I / 30 NEXT I / 40 END` → stdout
  `"1\n2\n3\n"`.

Spec: `code/specs/PL05-dartmouth-basic-iir-compiler.md`.
