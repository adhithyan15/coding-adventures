# Changelog

All notable changes to the `ruby-to-semantic-ir` crate will be documented in this file.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added (Phase 6a — `def name(params) … end` method definitions)
- New `collect_def_statements` pre-pass hoists every `def_statement` from the program to a top-level `semantic_ir::Function` *before* the main-body lowerer runs.
- `lower_def_statement` translates the AST node into a `Function`:
  - The first `Name` token after the leading `def` keyword becomes the function name (the `def` keyword itself is skipped so the function isn't named `"def"`).
  - The optional `params` sub-rule's `Name` tokens become `Param`s.
  - The body is lowered using a *fresh* `declared_locals` set so the outer program's bindings don't leak in.  Params are pre-declared as locals (so `x = 2` inside `def f(x)` routes through `Stmt::Assign`) *and* tracked in a new `current_params` set so `VarRef` to them gets `Scope::Param` (the validator's expectation for parameters).
  - The tail expression (if any) is promoted to the body block's `value`; otherwise `value = NilLit`.
- `Module::manifest` now declares `Feature::DynamicTyping` — Ruby is dynamically typed, and the SIR validator requires this whenever a module produces untyped params or globals.
- `def_statement` nodes left behind in the program body lower to a no-op `Stmt::ExprStmt(NilLit)` so the SIR-level statement stream stays in sync with the source line count.

### Tests (+5 new, total 14)
- `def_lowers_to_top_level_function` — `def add(x, y); x + y; end` produces an `add` function with two params and a `+` builtin call body.
- `def_with_no_params_lowers_cleanly` — `def hello; end` produces a paramless function whose body value is `NilLit`.
- `def_does_not_leak_locals_to_outer_scope` — locals in a method body don't leak into the program-level scope (each gets its own first-occurrence `LetBinding`).
- `def_with_param_reassignment_routes_through_assign` — `def f(x); x = 2; end` re-binds via `Stmt::Assign` (the param is pre-declared as local).
- `module_with_def_passes_sir_validator` — a `def`-containing module passes `semantic_ir::validate`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added (Phase 5 — initial Ruby → SIR frontend)
- New crate `ruby-to-semantic-ir`.  Consumes `coding-adventures-ruby-parser`'s `GrammarASTNode` and emits a `semantic_ir::Module`.
- `compile_source(source, module_name) -> Result<Module, RubyLowerError>` — tokenize → parse → lower in one call.
- `compile(ast, module_name) -> Result<Module, RubyLowerError>` — lower an already-parsed AST.
- `RubyLowerError` — carries a human-readable message plus 1-based line/column drawn from the AST node's span.
- v0 lowering covers everything ruby-parser v0 parses:
  - Programs → synthesised `main` function whose body is the sequence of lowered statements.  Last bare-expression statement becomes the block's `value`; otherwise `value = NilLit`.
  - Assignments (`x = expr`) → `LetBinding` for first occurrence, `Assign` for subsequent re-bindings (scope is `Local`).
  - Method calls (`name(args...)`) → `BuiltinCall` for the known builtin set (`puts`, `print`, `p`, `gets`, `raise`); other names lower to `DirectCall` (placeholder; in v0 there are no user-defined functions, so backends will flag these as unresolved).
  - Expressions: integer literals, string literals, name references, binary `+ - * /` lowered to `BuiltinCall("+"...)` etc., parenthesised sub-expressions.
- Tests cover empty program, single assignment, multi-statement programs, arithmetic, method calls, re-assignment routing through `Stmt::Assign`, and tail-expression promotion to block `value`.
