# Changelog

All notable changes to the `coding-adventures-ruby-lexer` crate will be documented in this file.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-19

### Changed (BREAKING)
- Replaced the regex-based `lexer::GrammarLexer` backend with a TOML-encoded state machine driven by `state_machine::EffectfulStateMachine`.  This is **Phase 1** of the multi-phase plan in [code/specs/ruby-parser.md](../../../specs/ruby-parser.md).
- Source of truth is [`ruby-1.8.lexer.states.toml`](./ruby-1.8.lexer.states.toml) at the crate root; the action interpreter in `src/lib.rs` turns its effect strings into `lexer::token::Token` values.
- `create_ruby_lexer(source)` is gone; replaced by `RubyLexer::new(version)` which constructs a versioned lexer (`"1.8"` is currently the only accepted value).
- `tokenize_ruby(source)` keeps its signature.  A new `tokenize_ruby_diag(source)` variant returns the diagnostic list alongside the tokens.

### Added
- `RubyLexer` struct with explicit `push` / `finish` / `drain_tokens` / `diagnostics` methods.
- `Diagnostic` struct for non-fatal lex errors — the lexer never panics on malformed input.
- Newline as a first-class token (`TokenType::Newline`); Ruby treats `\n` as a statement terminator.
- Method-name suffixes `?` and `!` are now part of the identifier token (`empty?`, `save!`).

### Phase 1 scope
- Identifiers (with `?` / `!` suffix), integers (with `_` separators), strings (`"..."` and `'...'`, no interpolation), line comments, common operators (`+ - * / % == != < > <= >= = ! && || => ** ::` …), and basic punctuation.
- **Heredocs, regex literals, string interpolation, parser-driven `f /x/` disambiguation, and the 1.9.1+ syntax additions are deferred to subsequent phases** (see [ruby-parser.md](../../../specs/ruby-parser.md) §"Phasing").

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- `create_ruby_lexer(source)` — factory function that loads `ruby.tokens` and returns a configured `GrammarLexer`.
- `tokenize_ruby(source)` — convenience function that tokenizes Ruby source and returns `Vec<Token>`.
- Loads grammar from `ruby.tokens` using `env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR")` for reliable path resolution.
- Test suite covering assignments, keywords, arithmetic operators, comparison operators, strings, numbers, comments, delimiters, whitespace, method definitions, symbols, and the factory function.
