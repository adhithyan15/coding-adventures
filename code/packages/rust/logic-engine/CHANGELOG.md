All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- `proof_dag` module: `ProofDAG`, `Proof`, `ProofStep`, `DerivationOrigin`
  — the engine's return type when enumeration is active. Each `Proof`
  records its final substitution, an ordered list of derivation steps,
  and de-duplicated `via_facts` / `via_rules` lists that name every
  probabilistic clause the proof depends on.
- `enumerate` module: `enumerate_all(query, kb)` — exhaustive SLD that
  collects every successful derivation rather than stopping at the
  first. Uses the same fresh-variable renaming as `find_first` so that
  multiple clause instantiations don't share variable identity.
  Negation-as-failure is the well-founded reading per LP19.
- `wmc` module: `weighted_model_count(dag, kb)` — naïve enumeration
  over `2^n` worlds, where `n` is the count of distinct probabilistic
  clauses across all proofs. Certain clauses are automatically true
  and do not contribute degrees of freedom. The shared-fact case is
  handled correctly because WMC counts worlds, not paths.
- `SearchResult` enum with `FindFirstResult` and `EnumerateAllResult`
  variants, plus a top-level `search(query, kb, mode)` function. In
  `AutoDetect` mode the engine inspects `kb.is_all_certain()` and
  selects `FindFirst` when every clause is `Certain` — the LP19
  short-circuit theorem made executable.
- `KnowledgeBase::find_fact_by_id` and `find_rule_by_id` — linear-scan
  lookup used by the WMC backend to recover Bernoulli parameters from
  clause ids. Sufficient at current scale; an indexed alternative may
  arrive in a later slice.
- 11 new tests (4 enumerate, 7 wmc, 4 integration) including the
  canonical `P(path(a,c)) = 0.86` graph reachability and the
  shared-fact case that fails under naïve inclusion-exclusion (correctly
  returns 0.5 here, would be 0.75 under the wrong algorithm). Total:
  30 tests.

### Scope notes

This slice completes the probabilistic core specified in
[`LP19`](../../../specs/LP19-probabilistic-logic-core.md) for the naïve
inference path. `d-DNNF` / `SDD` compilation (LP19a), rational
arithmetic (LP19b), conditional probability with evidence (LP19c), and
approximate inference (LP19d) remain as planned follow-ups.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- `Probability` enum with two variants: `Certain` (semantic 1.0, recognized
  structurally for the LP19 short-circuit) and `Value(f64)` for genuine
  probabilities in `[0, 1]`.
- `Fact { id, term, probability }` carrying a stable `FactId` and a
  probability that defaults to `Certain`.
- `Rule { id, head, body, probability }` with `BodyLiteral::{Pos, Neg}`
  body literals (positive goals and negation-as-failure).
- `KnowledgeBase` — an indexed collection of Facts and Rules. Looks up
  by head functor/arity for fast clause selection during search.
- `SearchMode` enum: `FindFirst`, `EnumerateAll`, `AutoDetect`.
- `is_all_certain()` on `KnowledgeBase` — the precondition for the
  LP19 short-circuit. The implementation walks every Fact and Rule once
  and is `O(|KB|)`.
- `find_first(query, kb)` — deterministic SLD-style resolution over the
  KB. Returns the first successful `Substitution` or `None`. Uses the
  unification from `logic-core` and the KB's clause index for clause
  selection.
- 14 tests covering: deterministic facts, rules with bodies, multiple
  clauses with backtracking, the all-Certain short-circuit detection,
  rejection of anonymous probabilistic clauses (well-formedness), and a
  small "family relations" worked example used by the LP layer's
  educational specs.

### Scope

This is the first slice of [`LP19`](../../../specs/LP19-probabilistic-logic-core.md).
Subsequent slices will add:

- Proof DAG construction (return all successful derivations, not just
  the first).
- `EnumerateAll` and `AutoDetect` mode implementations.
- Naïve weighted-model-counting backend over the proof DAG's induced
  Boolean formula.
- d-DNNF / SDD compilation (LP19a).

The current slice deliberately limits itself to **deterministic
find-first search** so that the foundation can be reviewed before the
probabilistic backend is added.

### Notes

The Python reference at `code/packages/python/logic-engine` remains the
canonical interpretation. The Rust crate currently is a strict subset
of the Python API surface; subsequent PRs expand to parity.
