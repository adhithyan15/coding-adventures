- `language/word-families.adj` — extended with a SECOND word family, "-at" (cat, bat, fat, sat,
  rat, pat, mat, hat), added as eight new rows in the existing `word_family` table alongside the
  "-an" family shipped in the prior slice. The existing `rhymes_with` rule is reused UNCHANGED —
  it generalizes over any `$Family` value already in the table, so this slice required zero rule
  or engine changes, demonstrating the composition pattern scales to new vocabulary for free.
  Quoted verbatim from a DIFFERENT Reading Rockets page than the "-an" family's (a kindergarten
  phonological-awareness parent guide), documented in the file's header prose per the "one table,
  one declared provenance envelope, every other row-group's real citation in prose" discipline
  `physics/states-of-matter.adj` established. Deliberately excludes "flat" (a four-letter
  consonant-blend word) to preserve the strict three-letter CVC scope. No new manifest objective
  needed — extends the same already-covered library `adj.literacy.k2.rhyming_word_families`
  already references. New e2e test `rhymes_with_isolates_a_second_family_with_the_same_unmodified_rule`
  (4th test in `facts_wordfamilies_e2e.rs`), which also asserts NO cross-contamination between
  the two families.
