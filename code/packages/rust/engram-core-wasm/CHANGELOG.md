# Changelog — engram-core-wasm

## Unreleased

**APKG import and export now run on wasm.** `export_anki_apkg` and
`merge_anki_apkg` returned `"Anki APKG export/import is handled by native hosts
for WASM shells"` on `wasm32`, because `Cargo.toml` excluded
`engram-anki-package` from that target entirely — it linked bundled C SQLite and
libzstd, neither of which can target `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.

The package layer is now a dependency on every target: with default features
natively, and with `default-features = false` on wasm, which drops zstd and keeps
full legacy `.apkg` support. Both stubs are gone and both methods run the real
implementation everywhere.

This closes the one documented hole in the Mosaic host contract — the generated
HTML, WebComponent, and React hosts wired up file input and download helpers and
then had to surface a delegation error.
