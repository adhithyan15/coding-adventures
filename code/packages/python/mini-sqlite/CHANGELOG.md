# Changelog

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added

- Initial release. PEP 249 DB-API 2.0 facade over the full SQL pipeline.
- `mini_sqlite.connect(":memory:")` returns an in-memory `Connection`.
- Module globals: `apilevel="2.0"`, `threadsafety=1`, `paramstyle="qmark"`.
- `Connection` with `cursor()`, `commit()`, `rollback()`, `close()`,
  `execute()`, `executemany()`, and context manager support.
- `Cursor` with `execute()`, `executemany()`, `fetchone()`,
  `fetchmany()`, `fetchall()`, `description`, `rowcount`, iteration
  protocol, and `close()`.
- ASTNode → planner Statement adapter covering SELECT (with WHERE,
  ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET, DISTINCT, GROUP BY, HAVING, aggregates,
  INNER/CROSS joins), INSERT VALUES, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE TABLE
  [IF NOT EXISTS], DROP TABLE [IF EXISTS].
- `?` parameter binding via source-level substitution (the vendored SQL
  lexer has no QMARK token, so we escape values into SQL literals
  before handing the statement to the pipeline). Arity validated, with
  backslash-escape string literals to match the lexer's rules.
- `Project(Aggregate(...))` flattening pass in the engine so the codegen
  (which expects Aggregate as the core operator) can compile aggregate
  queries wrapped by the planner in a Project for schema uniformity.
- `INSERT INTO t VALUES (...)` without a column list resolves against
  the backend's declared schema before planning.
- PEP 249 exception hierarchy with translation from every underlying
  pipeline exception family, including lexer and parser errors →
  `ProgrammingError`.
- Output value coercion: `True`/`False` → `1`/`0` to match sqlite3.
