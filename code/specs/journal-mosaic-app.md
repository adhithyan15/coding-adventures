# journal-mosaic-app — Journal on the standard Mosaic application ABI (J3c-1)

Issue: [#14416](https://github.com/adhithyan15/coding-adventures/issues/14416) (J3c) ·
Engine: [`journal-core.md`](journal-core.md) · ABI: [`UI38-mosaic-native-application-runtime.md`](UI38-mosaic-native-application-runtime.md)

## What it is

The Rust application behind the Mosaic `journal-app` package (J3c-2). It puts
`journal-core` behind the standard `MosaicApp` trait (`mosaic-app-runtime`),
exactly as `task-mosaic-app` does for Trestle and `engram-mosaic-app` for Engram:
it turns engine state into the package's slot values (props) and the package's
events into engine commands. Every generated native host loads it as
`libmosaic_app` through `mosaic_app_capi::export_mosaic_app!`.

J3c is split so each half is reviewable: this crate (J3c-1) has no dependency on
the UI packages; the `journal-app` package (J3c-2) composes `RecordList` and
`DraftEditor` over these props.

## The editor model

The screen is a timeline beside one editor. The editor always holds a **draft**
for a **target**:

| target | draft | Save | Delete |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `New` | empty until typed | creates an entry dated **today** and makes it the target | not offered |
| `Entry(id)` | that entry's title/body, as edited | writes the edits | deletes it; target → `New` |

- **Select** a timeline row → target that entry, draft loaded from it.
- **New entry** → target `New`, empty draft.
- **Cancel** → discard edits: draft reloaded from the target (empty for `New`).
- Typing only changes the draft; nothing reaches the engine until Save. This is
  the controlled-editor contract `DraftEditor` specifies.
- Saving an entirely empty new draft is a no-op with an announcement, not an
  empty entry.

## Props (the slot contract)

| slot | type | value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `timeline-rows` | `list<list<text>>` | `RecordList` rows `[key, heading, title, subtitle, meta, badge]`, newest day first |
| `selected-key` | `text` | the target entry's id, `""` for `New` |
| `timeline-empty` | `bool` | no entries yet (drives the empty state) |
| `draft-title` | `text` | |
| `draft-body` | `text` | |
| `delete-label` | `text` | `"Delete"` for an existing entry, `""` for `New` (so `DraftEditor` hides the button) |

Row fields:

- `heading` — the day, e.g. `Thursday, 24 September 2026`, set **only on the
  first row of each day** (`RecordList`'s flattened grouping).
- `title` — the entry's title; for an untitled entry, the opening words of its
  body; failing that, `Untitled entry`. Never empty: `RecordList` draws the title
  as the row's button, and an empty one would be an unnamed button.
- `subtitle` — the first line of the body (markdown `#` markers stripped), at
  most 100 characters, cut on character boundaries; `""` when the title already
  came from the body.
- `meta` — `""` for now (see *Time zones*).
- `badge` — `★` for a starred entry.

## Events

The wire name is the raw emit name (`onX`), as every generated host sends it.

| event | payload |
| --- | --- |
| `onSelectEntry` | `{ index }` — a row of the `timeline-rows` just rendered |
| `onNewEntry` | — |
| `onTitleChange` | `{ value }` |
| `onBodyChange` | `{ value }` |
| `onSaveEntry` | — |
| `onDeleteEntry` | — |
| `onCancelEdit` | — |

An unknown event is an error naming it (UI38 §4.1), and any error leaves the app
exactly as it was (the dispatch clones and restores), so the host can retry.

## Ids and time

- Entry ids are minted here, `entry-{n}`, skipping any already in use — the
  core never mints (it validates: ≤ 64 printable ASCII bytes).
- The clock is a plain `fn() -> u64` (milliseconds since the epoch), defaulting
  to the system clock and replaced in tests.
- **Time zones.** `StartContext` carries no time zone, so "today" is the **UTC**
  date, and the row `meta` does not show a time of day (a UTC clock time would
  read as wrong). Both change when the ABI carries a zone; tracked in the backlog.

## Persistence

`snapshot()` serialises the journal, the target and the draft (schema
`journal-mosaic-app/state`, version 1), so an unsaved draft survives a restart.
`restore` refuses a foreign schema, another version, corrupt bytes, or a journal
that fails `JournalState::validate()`; a target naming a missing entry is
repaired to `New`.

## Deferred

Web host, native packaging and CI lanes, release (J5); the markdown preview;
search, on-this-day, tags and stars in the UI; the journal switcher; moving an
entry to another day; importing the TypeScript app's entries.
