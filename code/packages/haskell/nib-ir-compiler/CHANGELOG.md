# Changelog

## Unreleased

- `BUILD_windows` now runs `cabal test all` unconditionally. It used to run Cabal only if
  `%ProgramFiles%\cabal\bin\cabal.exe` existed, which it never does on the CI runner, so the
  tests were silently skipped on Windows.
- `BUILD_windows` runs under `cmd.exe`: the POSIX `sh` form (`command -v`, `/dev/null`) failed there, so it now uses the repo's `if exist "%ProgramFiles%\cabal\bin\cabal.exe" (...)` idiom.
- The Darwin BUILD now runs Cabal with the Command Line Tools developer dir
  (`DEVELOPER_DIR=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`), so GHC 9.4.8's CLT SDK
  sysroot gets the matching linker on macOS CI with Command Line Tools 27.

## 0.1.0

- Add Haskell Nib-to-IR lowering for the convergence smoke subset.
