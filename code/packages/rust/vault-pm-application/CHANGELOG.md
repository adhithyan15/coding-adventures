# Changelog

All notable changes to this package are documented here.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- Exact canonical application wrappers for authority-signed device
  certificates and device-signed commits.
- An authority-anchored VLT-PM04 verifier for the single authorized Phase 1A
  device.

### Security

- Commit frames are ID-checked, AEAD-opened as the commit kind, strictly
  decoded, identity-bound, and Ed25519-verified before repository use.
- Verifier construction requires the locally pinned certificate frame to
  reproduce its expected object ID before authority verification.
- Announcements must match the authorized vault, device, certificate object,
  and signing key; all verifier failures remain payload-free.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- Closed canonical codecs for local device secrets, item revisions, and
  bounded catalog snapshots.
- Lossless observed-set persistence, including retained add operations and
  removal tombstones.
- V1 HKDF subkey derivation and domain-separated XChaCha20-Poly1305 object
  framing over caller-provided randomness.

### Security

- Strict kind, vault, suite, bound, and AEAD checks before plaintext parsing.
- Zeroizing live keys, local secret state, object DEKs, and opened plaintext.
- Closed payload-free diagnostics and a capability-free package boundary.
