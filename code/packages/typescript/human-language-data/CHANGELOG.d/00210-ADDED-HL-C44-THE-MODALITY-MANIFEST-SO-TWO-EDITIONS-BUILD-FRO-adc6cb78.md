### Added — HL-C44 the modality manifest, so two editions build from one source

- Add `src/modality-manifest.ts` and `src/modality-cli.ts`, emitting
  `code/learning/human-languages/core/lesson-modality.json`. HL-C14 already derived
  `voice`/`sight`/`pen` per lesson and a drivable prefix per chapter, but only at
  runtime and only into the human-readable gap report — a paragraph of English is not
  something a book builder can filter on. This slice makes the derivation *data*, so
  the complete book, the app, and the forthcoming dictation-friendly driving edition
  (HL-C43) each filter the same canonical corpus rather than maintaining three copies.
- **Per lesson:** `id`, `language`, `chapter`, `sequence`, `modality`, `derived`,
  `drivable`, `reasons`, and the lesson AST's `sourceHash`. The three override fields
  (`authored`, `authoredReason`, `overridden`) are emitted only on the lessons that
  have them, rather than a thousand copies of the empty string. The monotone closure
  (`pen` implies `sight`) is deliberately *not* emitted: it is a three-entry lookup
  table, and restating it beside every pen lesson would add sixty kilobytes of
  duplicating `requiredChannels()`.
- **Per chapter:** the drivable prefix, `firstNonVoiceLesson`, the modality union,
  whether the whole chapter is drivable, and `drivableLessonIds` — the prefix spelled
  out in order, so a driving-edition renderer never has to re-implement "authored
  order" and quietly disagree with the generator about it.
- **Per corpus:** a `summary` pinned by tests — 1,096 lessons, 708 `voice`, 337
  `sight`, 51 `pen`, 65% drivable, 20 tracks, 375 chapters, 551 lessons reachable in
  the car once prerequisite order is respected, 199 fully drivable chapters, 121 that
  cannot be started by ear at all, zero overrides, zero chapterless lessons.
- **Designed for HL-C41's block-level modality to land additively.** Every lesson row
  is a JSON object, not a positional tuple. `modality` keeps its meaning permanently —
  the strongest channel the lesson needs *anywhere* — so a consumer that never learns
  about block modality keeps producing a correct, merely pessimistic driving edition,
  which is the safe direction to be wrong in. `coreModality` arrives as a new optional
  key beside it (`entry.coreModality ?? entry.modality` is correct before and after),
  and the header's `features.blockModality` flag says at a glance whether a build
  carries block data. The shape of the companion block records is deliberately not
  guessed here: an absent key is additive, a wrong key is a breaking change.
- **Nothing is authored.** The manifest is derived, exactly like
  `core/generated-book-hashes.json`. HL08 refused to add `modality:` to 1,096
  frontmatter files precisely because that is 1,096 places for a computed fact to go
  stale, and this artifact does not reintroduce the problem.
- Add `npm run generate:modality` / `npm run check:modality`, mirroring the
  `generate:books` / `check:books` contract: `generatedModalityOutputs()` returns a
  path → content map so `--write` and `--check` consume identical bytes, `--check`
  compares byte for byte and exits 1 on any drift, and the corpus is fingerprinted with
  `fnv1a64` from `hash.ts`.
- Wire `npm run check:modality` into `human-languages-books.yml` beside
  `check:books`. A stale manifest is not cosmetic: a lesson that gained a paradigm
  table would still read `drivable: true`, and the driving edition would tell somebody
  at 70mph to look at a chart. The `books-gate` job's name expression and pass/fail
  contract are untouched.
- Add `loadModalityManifest()` and `modalityManifestById()` to `loader.ts`, exported
  from `index.ts` with the manifest types. The index returns a `Map`, never a plain
  object: the keys come out of parsed JSON, and `index[lesson.id] = lesson` with an id
  of `__proto__` writes the prototype instead of a property.
- Ordering is total and null-last (track, chapter, `sequence`, id), so the file is
  byte-stable regardless of directory-walk order — otherwise `--check` would fail on a
  colleague's machine for no reason. The corpus fingerprint sorts by id rather than
  reusing `combineLessonHashes`, whose `sequence`-first ordering degenerates on the
  many lessons that carry no sequence (`Number(undefined)` is `NaN`, and every
  comparison against `NaN` is false).
- `safeOutput()` fails closed on path escape, checking containment *after* `resolve`
  rather than scanning the input string for `..`, and requires a `.json` extension so a
  mistake cannot land on an authored `.tex` chapter or `.md` lesson.
- 33 new tests: manifest round-trip, order-independent bytes, drift detection
  (including a byte-level reformat), the missing-manifest case, the full path-escape
  matrix, the `__proto__` index case, the additive-`coreModality` read, and the corpus
  summary pinned field by field. `modality-manifest.ts` reaches 100% statement
  coverage. No existing assertion was weakened.
