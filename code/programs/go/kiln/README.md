# Kiln

Kiln is a language-agnostic, content-addressed build system. The design is in
[KILN00](../../../specs/KILN00-kiln-build-system.md); this program is its Go
implementation, built up one spec at a time.

## What is here today

- `internal/key` - the canonical **action key** encoder of
  [KILN02](../../../specs/KILN02-key-encoding.md) (key schema 1). A key is
  `SHA-256(preimage)`, where the preimage is a length-framed, section-named,
  bytewise-sorted encoding of everything that could change a build result.
  The encoder validates strictly and refuses (never repairs) non-canonical
  input.
- Golden vectors at
  [`code/specs/fixtures/kiln/key-vectors-v1.json`](../../../specs/fixtures/kiln/key-vectors-v1.json)
  that any implementation must reproduce.
- A tiny CLI.

It uses only the Go standard library and depends on no other package in this
repository.

## Usage

```
go build -o kiln .
./kiln version                                   # kiln 0.1.0 (key schema 1)
./kiln verify-vectors ../../../specs/fixtures/kiln/key-vectors-v1.json
```

```go
k, err := key.Key(action)   // [32]byte
fmt.Println(key.Hex(k))     // 64 lowercase hex characters
```

## Regenerating the vectors

The vectors are defined in `internal/key/vectors_def_test.go`:

```
go test ./internal/key -run TestGenerateVectors -update
```

Changing a vector's expected value is a key-schema change; bump the version
in KILN02 first.

## Testing

```
go vet ./... && go test ./... -cover
```
