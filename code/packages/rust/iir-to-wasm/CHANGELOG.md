## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-11

### Added

- Initial release of the `iir-to-wasm` crate.
- `validate_for_wasm()` — pre-flight validation of `IIRModule` for WASM
  lowering.  Reports human-readable errors for empty modules, empty
  functions, untyped instructions, unsupported types, and unsupported ops.
  Unlike the BEAM backend, float type hints (`f32`, `f64`) and float
  constants (`Operand::Float`) are fully supported.
- `IIRWasmConfig` — configuration struct for the lowering pass.  Carries the
  WASM module name.
- `IIRWasmError` — structured error enum for lowering failures, covering
  `ValidationFailed`, `UnsupportedOp`, `UnsupportedType`, `UndefinedLabel`,
  `UndefinedVariable`, and `InvalidOperand`.
- `lower_iir_to_wasm()` — two-pass lowering from `IIRModule` to `WasmModule`.
  - Pass 1: per-function register allocation and local type inference.
  - Pass 2: instruction code generation — arithmetic, bitwise, comparisons,
    constants (i32/i64/f64), function calls, and control flow.
  - Control flow: dispatch-loop pattern for functions with labels/jumps;
    linear emission for functions without.
  - Every function is exported by name.
- `codegen.rs` — internal encoding helpers for WASM binary opcodes: signed
  and unsigned LEB128 immediates, `local.get`/`local.set`, `br`/`br_if`,
  `i32.const`, `i64.const`, `f64.const`, and the binary opcode table.
- `tests/test_backend.rs` — 40+ integration tests covering validation, module
  structure, FunctionBody correctness, encoding round-trips, and all
  major opcode families.
