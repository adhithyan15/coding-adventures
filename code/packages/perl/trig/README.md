## Full-range square root

The square-root API follows PHY00 across the full binary64 range. It preserves
negative zero, returns positive infinity and NaN unchanged, rejects negative
inputs with the lane-native error, normalizes by powers of four into `[0.25, 4)`,
and then applies at most 60 Newton steps without calling the host square-root
routine. Boundary behavior is checked against
[`trig.json`](../../../specs/fixtures/phy00-phy01-v1/cases/trig.json).
