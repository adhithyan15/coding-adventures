- **Launches on Qt (J5a).** CI's Qt lane builds this package with the strict
  standard binding against `journal-mosaic-app`, installs it and launches it
  twice offscreen, restoring the second time. It also runs this package's
  tests, which nothing ran before, because the package opts out of the Rust
  workspace.
