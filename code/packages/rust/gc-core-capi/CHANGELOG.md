# Changelog — gc-core-capi

All notable changes to this crate are documented here.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-16

Initial release. C ABI for `gc-core`'s flat-native heap — LANG16's
`gc_runtime_<target>.a` companion, superseding `twig-aot/runtime/twig_gc.c`
(AOT00 T1, spec `AOT00-T1-precise-gc.md` §3.1 / §11).

### Added

- `libgc_core_capi.a` / `.dylib` / `.so` exposing a stable C ABI over
  `gc_core::FlatHeap`:
  - `__gc_alloc(n)` — real-pointer allocation of `n` zeroed, 16-byte-aligned bytes.
  - `__gc_alloc_kind(n, kind)` — as above with a `HeapKind` id for later precise
    tracing.
  - `__gc_collect_roots(roots, count)` — explicit-root mark-and-sweep; returns
    objects freed.
  - `__gc_live_bytes()` / `__gc_collection_count()` — introspection.
  - `__gc_reset()` — drop the whole heap.
- `include/gc_core.h` C header.
- Host test exercising the full alloc → write → collect → reset flow over the
  exported ABI (real pointers, conservative tracing, exact reclamation).

### Notes

- One process-wide heap behind a `Mutex` (single-threaded native runtime model,
  matching `twig_gc.c`).
- This is **T1 rung 0**: the linkable collector with explicit-root collection.
  Wiring `twig-aot` to link it (retiring `twig_gc.c`), the conservative C-stack
  scan (argument-less `collect`), and the precise/moving/generational rungs are
  follow-up PRs.
