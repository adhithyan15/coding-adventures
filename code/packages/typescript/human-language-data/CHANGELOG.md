# Changelog

All notable changes to `@coding-adventures/human-language-data` are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added — non-Latin canonical book chapters

- Let a generated-book target declare a Unicode Script property and its existing
  LaTeX font command, wrapping only target-script runs while keeping surrounding
  prose in the book's main font.
- Use authored romanization for non-Latin section bookmarks and fail closed when
  only half of the script-rendering configuration is present.
- Generate Marathi Chapter 6 from its two strict canonical lessons and expose the
  same ordered source hash to Language Ladder.
- Generate Gujarati Chapter 6 from its two strict canonical lessons, preserving
  Gujarati-script runs and bookmark-safe romanization from the shared AST.

### Added — block-boundary knowledge closure

- Parse canonical `hl-knowledge` directives beside every schema-v2 body block
  while excluding the metadata from learner-facing Markdown.
- Validate introductions and assessments in rendered order, reject undeclared or
  unavailable prompt knowledge, and require production and recall blocks to name
  what they assess.
- Migrate all 51 Spanish Chapters 1–6 lessons to the fail-closed block contract
  and refresh their shared app/book source hashes.

### Added — canonical LaTeX chapter generation

- Added deterministic lesson-AST fingerprints and a pure Markdown-block to
  LaTeX renderer, now covering all 24 Spanish Chapter 1–3 schema-v2 lessons.
- Preserved nested inline emphasis, wrapped long practice lists, and emitted
  text-safe short titles for running headers and PDF bookmarks.
- Added write/check CLI modes, a committed chapter-hash manifest, path-safety
  validation, and a unified-book CI drift gate.
- Exposed each parsed lesson's source hash so book and app consumers can verify
  that they loaded the same canonical content.

### Added — schema-v2 lesson AST and strict curriculum contract

- Parse one-level nested lesson frontmatter and losslessly expose level-two
  Markdown sections as stable typed body blocks.
- Enforce schema-v2 spine mapping, local sequence, strict computed duration,
  block shape, coverage metadata, same-language prerequisites, stable knowledge
  atoms, unique introductions, and transitive knowledge closure.
- Prove the contract on all 24 Spanish Chapter 1–3 lessons while preserving
  schema-v1 compatibility for the rest of the corpus.

### Added — curriculum migration gap report

- Added deterministic JSON and text reports for effective lesson duration,
  unknown and omitted prerequisites, book-chapter coverage, and per-track schema
  migration status.
- Added a CLI format switch so CI can publish both report forms with the unified
  human-language book artifact without turning existing migration debt into a
  false regression gate.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added — `writing` lesson type (orthography / writing nuances)
- **New exempt lesson type `writing`** for lessons that teach a *writing-system*
  nuance — an accent mark, a diacritic, an inverted punctuation mark — rather
  than a vocabulary word. Its `headword` is the mark itself and it carries **no
  `concept_tag`** (a mark does not join across languages), so it is exempt from
  the cross-language concept join, exactly like `practice`/`review`.
- Validator now accepts `writing` without flagging `unknown-type` or requiring a
  concept; added a test covering it. Supports the curriculum's "teach the
  accent marks and other writing nuances" goal (HL00) and gives HL02's
  hand-writing practice a lesson type to draw from.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-18

### Changed — general script model (teach any writing system)
- **`Script` is now an open string**, not a closed union — a new script needs no
  type edit.
- **Generalized the script-data schema** to cover all three families with one
  shape: `alphabet`, `abugida`, `abjad`. `ScriptData` gains `name`, `direction`
  (ltr/rtl), `system`, and `complete`; `Glyph`→`Letter` (with `role`, optional
  contextual `forms` for cursive/abjad scripts, `inherentVowel` for abugidas);
  `VowelSign`→`Mark` (vowel signs *or* harakat/niqqud). (Breaking, but nothing
  consumed the old shape yet.)
- **Tracks may self-declare their script** via `<track>/track.json`
  (`{ "script": "hebrew" }`); `parseLesson` takes an optional resolved script and
  the loader passes it in. Adding a new-script language needs no shared-map edit.
- **Coverage hardens with `complete`**: unknown headword characters are warnings
  while a script file has `"complete": false`, and become errors once it's `true`.

### Added
- `data/scripts/devanagari.json` (abugida) and `data/scripts/arabic.json`
  (abjad, rtl, contextual forms) — the two reference inventories proving the
  general schema across LTR-abugida and RTL-abjad.
- `data/scripts/README.md` — the "add any script" checklist (Gujarati, Bengali,
  Hebrew, …): author `<script>.json`, vendor the font, point a track at it.
- `trackScript` loader export; tests for open script ids, contextual-form
  coverage, and complete→error escalation.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added
- Initial release — the HL01 data layer over the Human Languages curriculum.
- **Types** (`types.ts`): `Concept`, `Realization`, `Dataset`, `Taxonomy`,
  `ScriptData`/`Glyph`/`VowelSign`, `Issue`.
- **Frontmatter reader** (`frontmatter.ts`): a tiny zero-dependency parser for the
  `key: value` / `[list]` frontmatter shape the lesson schema uses (BOM- and
  CRLF-tolerant, quote-stripping, comment-skipping).
- **Parser** (`parse.ts`): `parseLesson` derives a `Realization` from lesson
  frontmatter (romanization defaults to headword for Latin scripts; gender sniffed
  from the gloss when unfielded); `buildDataset` joins content lessons through the
  taxonomy into concepts + per-language indexes.
- **Validator** (`validate.ts`): the round-trip consistency gate — resolves every
  concept tag, forbids duplicate realizations per language, checks required fields
  and field shapes, script-glyph coverage, and core-concept coverage. Errors fail
  CI; warnings/info are tolerated.
- **Queries** (`queries.ts`): `allConcepts`, `conceptsByLanguage`,
  `languagesForConcept`, `coverageByLanguage`.
- **Loader + CLI** (`loader.ts`, `cli.ts`): the filesystem boundary — reads the
  curriculum and runs `validate`. Declared `fs:read`/`fs:list` capabilities.
- Tests for the pure core (frontmatter, parse, validate, queries) plus an
  integration test that validates the **real** curriculum in CI and asserts the
  cross-language joins (e.g. `GREETING-HELLO` across all 16 tracks).

### Notes
- `data/scripts/*.json` character-breakdown data is authored incrementally in
  follow-up work; the package degrades gracefully when it is absent.
