## 0.1.1 — SIR17 exhaustiveness (no behaviour change)

semantic-ir 0.2.0 adds `Stmt::ClassDef` (the SIR17 class node).  This
backend gains a `ClassDef` match arm in its statement emitter so it
stays exhaustive.  The arm `panic!`s with a "capability check should
have rejected it" message: `Feature::Classes` is not in this
backend's accepted-feature set, so a class-using module is rejected
at the capability check before emit, making the arm unreachable.  No
output or accepted-feature changes.

## 0.1.0 — initial release (SIR14 v0)

Third backend for the narrow-waist Semantic IR.  Emits
self-contained Python 3 source from a `semantic_ir::Module`.

### Added

- `PythonBackend` implementing `semantic_ir::Backend` with
  `target_tag = "python"`, accepting the v0 feature set minus
  `TailCalls` and `Intrinsics`.
- `compile(module)` convenience function.
- Per-node lowering matching SIR14 §"Per-node lowering rules".
- Inlined Python runtime (~140 lines) with `Symbol`, `Pair`,
  `Closure` classes, all 15 Twig builtins, symbol interning,
  module globals, and a builtin dispatch table.
- Block-as-expression via Python 3.8+ assignment expressions
  (walrus) — `((x := 1), (y := x + 2), result)[-1]`.
- Identifier sanitisation:
  - Valid Python identifiers pass through.
  - Python keywords get an underscore suffix (`def_`, `class_`).
  - Invalid characters encoded as `_<hex>` forms.
  - Empty input → `_sir_empty`.
  - SIR's `main` is renamed to `_sir_user_main`.
- `sanitize_comment` strips line terminators from external strings
  written into `#` comments — mirrors SIR12 / SIR13.
- 18 unit + end-to-end tests covering identity, arithmetic, and
  closure-adder pipelines from Twig source.

### Deferred

- Type hint enrichment (`def foo(x: int) -> int:`).
- Source maps.
- `async def` / `await` support.
- Raw-Python intrinsic injection.
