## 0.3.0 — Spaced-repetition scheduler wired into Practice

- **New pure module `src/scheduler.ts`** — a Leitner / SM-2-lite scheduler
  measured in **sessions** (no wall-clock, no `Date`), the "core module" of HL02.
  Each item tracks a Leitner box, `dueAtSession`, lapses, and reps; a correct
  answer promotes the box and expands the interval (1 → 3 → 7 → 15 → 30 sessions),
  a wrong answer drops it to box 0 (due again immediately). `pickNext` returns the
  most-overdue item deterministically (ties → fewest reps → lowest index), falling
  back to the soonest-due so practice never stalls.
- **Practice mode now uses it**: instead of a random letter each question, the
  **scheduler chooses** which letter to ask, so missed letters resurface soon and
  mastered ones fade back — real spaced repetition. Each answer advances the
  session clock and feeds `review`. A **"mastered N / total"** read-out joins the
  score line. (Randomness stays only in distractor choice + answer position.)
- **14 new unit tests (36 total)** covering promotion/expansion, lapse-reset,
  `pickNext` ordering + tie-breaks + the never-stall fallback, immutability, and
  an integration check (a correct streak masters an item; a miss resurfaces).
