### Changed — HL-C38: the generated books read as books, not as exports

- **`src/book.ts` gains one documented "book voice" section.** Lessons are
  authored as audio scripts (HL00) so a track can be recorded; the book view was
  printing those stage directions. It no longer does. The transformation is
  book-view only — `block.markdown` still holds every cue, and a future narration
  exporter must read it directly rather than reusing `bookVoice`.
  - `[PAUSE Ns]` is deleted. A reader paces themselves.
  - `[REPEAT xN]` becomes prose: *Twice through:* …
  - `[YOU <VERB>: …]` becomes a printed practice prompt. A run of bullets sharing
    one verb gets a single lead-in (*Say these aloud:*); a mixed or lone cue gets
    a per-bullet italic label (*Say it:*, *Write it:*, *Trace it:*). Twenty-eight
    cue verbs are mapped in `CUE_VOICES`, with a sentence-case fallback so an
    unmapped verb still prints as English. Writing and tracing prompts are real
    printed exercises and are never suppressed.
- **Printed block headings.** The internal block-type names are replaced from one
  table, `BOOK_BLOCK_TITLES`: `Guided Practice` → **Your turn**, `Wrap-up recall`
  → **Before you move on**, `You'll want to know first` → **What to know first**.
  The warm-up loses its printed label entirely and stands as the section's
  indented lead-in — several lessons share a chapter, and a bold `Warm-up.` five
  times on one spread reads like a worksheet. Headings the author extended with a
  descriptive tail are left untouched.
- **The chapter blurb is gone.** Every chapter opened with "This chapter is
  generated from the canonical micro-lessons used by Language Ladder. Each
  section stays independently resumable…". Books do not describe their build
  system.
- **Links: the book is a standalone artefact.** `absoluteBookLink` replaces
  `resolveMarkdownLink`. Absolute HTTP(S) citations (UT Austin, MSU, Wiktionary)
  stay live `\href`s; repository-relative destinations print their label with no
  link, because a reader holding the PDF cannot follow them. `sourceBaseUrl` is
  still required and validated in `book-generation.json` — it is that config's
  statement of where the curriculum lives — but it no longer reaches the
  renderer, so `BookGenerationTarget.sourceBaseUrl` and `MarkdownRenderContext`
  are removed.
- `bookVoice` and `bookBlockTitle` are exported for testing and reuse.
- Regenerated all 270 chapters. Source hashes are unchanged: no lesson file was
  edited, and `core/generated-book-hashes.json` is byte-identical.
