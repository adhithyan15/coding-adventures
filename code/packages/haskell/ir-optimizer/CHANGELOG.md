# Changelog

## Unreleased

- `BUILD` runs Cabal with `DEVELOPER_DIR=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools` on Darwin so GHC 9.4.8 links with the Command Line Tools linker that accepts the CLT SDK's `arm64e.x1` stubs; other platforms are unchanged.
- `BUILD_windows` runs under `cmd.exe`: the POSIX `sh` form (`command -v`, `/dev/null`) failed there, so it now uses the repo's `if exist "%ProgramFiles%\cabal\bin\cabal.exe" (...)` idiom; packages that had no `BUILD_windows` get one, so the Darwin guard never reaches `cmd.exe`.

## 0.1.0

- Add a conservative no-op optimizer wrapper for Haskell IR pipelines.
