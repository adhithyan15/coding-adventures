- `language/word-families.adj` — extended with a FOURTH word family, "-ug" (tug, rug, hug, mug,
  jug, dug, bug), added as seven new rows in the existing `word_family` table alongside "-an",
  "-at", and "-ig". The existing `rhymes_with` rule is reused UNCHANGED for the fourth time
  running. Quoted verbatim from a SIBLING Super Teacher Worksheets page to "-ig"'s (same site,
  same `consensus` trust tier, its own real citation): "This printable word family unit covers
  words that end with the letters -ug. List includes: snug, plug, slug, shrug, tug, rug, hug, mug,
  jug, dug, and bug." — WebFetch-verified twice for consistency, mirroring "-ig"'s bar.
  Deliberately excludes "snug", "plug", "slug", and "shrug" (four- and five-letter
  consonant-blend words) to preserve the strict three-letter CVC scope, the same discipline every
  prior family has used. No new manifest objective needed — extends the same already-covered
  library `adj.literacy.k2.rhyming_word_families`. New e2e test
  `rhymes_with_isolates_a_fourth_family_and_abstains_on_excluded_blend_words` (6th test in
  `facts_wordfamilies_e2e.rs`), which asserts NO cross-contamination with any of the three prior
  families AND honest abstention on "snug".
