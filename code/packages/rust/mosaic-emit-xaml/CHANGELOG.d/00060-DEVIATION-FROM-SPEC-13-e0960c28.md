### Deviation from spec §13

The spec's `if_helpers` field on `XamlEmitResult` is intended to carry
helper sources as separate files. PR-2 inlines the helpers directly
into the code-behind `partial class` instead, leaving `if_helpers`
empty. The motivation is that one `.xaml.cs` file is simpler to
review and slot into a WinUI 3 project than a sibling `.cs` per
helper. If a reviewer prefers the separate-file shape, the inlining
can flip cheaply — the registration mechanism (`EmitContext::helpers`)
already shapes the data the right way for either output.
