## 0.1.0 — v0 core (SIR25)

First release of the Ruby backend — the seventh SIR backend and the first Ruby
*target* (Ruby was previously only a frontend).

### Added

- `compile(module)` / `RubyBackend` implementing `semantic_ir::Backend`
  (`target_tag() == "ruby"`).
- **Self-contained** emission: a single `.rb` file with a small inlined runtime
  preamble (`SirPair`, a `$sir_globals` store, `sir_truthy`, display helpers
  that honour the display convention, `sir_eq`, `sir_apply`, and a
  builtin-as-value dispatcher).  Runs with `ruby <file>.rb`, no gems.
- **Expression-oriented lowering**: because Ruby's `if`/`begin…end` yield values
  and a method returns its last expression, `Block`/`If` render directly — no
  IIFE or statement-hoisting.  `MakeClosure` renders as a native lambda that
  binds the capture values and splats the call arguments; `IndirectCall` is
  `target.call(*args)`.
- v0 capability set (`Closures`, `Pairs`, `Symbols`, `Strings`, `DynamicTyping`,
  `OptionalTypeAnnotations`, `MutualRecursion`, `Globals`) plus the core
  builtins `+ - * / % neg = == != < > <= >= not and or cons car cdr null? pair?
  number? symbol? print puts global_get global_set` (mostly native Ruby, whose
  semantics are the reference).
- A structural gate rejecting builtins the v0 backend cannot lower (e.g. the
  `__method__`/`case_eq` collection-dispatch protocol), so a module using a
  later feature fails cleanly rather than emitting a call with no lowering.
- Identifier sanitisation (Ruby keywords, the `sir_` runtime namespace, and
  leading-uppercase locals) and string/symbol escaping that neutralises `#{…}`
  interpolation so no source text can inject.
- Display-convention substitution (`__SIR_DISPLAY_RUBY__` → a boolean-selected
  literal, never source text).

### Wiring

- Added to the Rust workspace `members`.
- `sir-conformance` gains a `Target::Ruby` arm (`run_ruby`, `ruby` toolchain,
  skip-if-absent); a program whose feature set v0 does not accept is *skipped*
  (a declared gap), not failed — mirroring the C backend.

### Verified

- `cargo test -p semantic-ir-to-ruby` green (emit-shape + end-to-end via `ruby`).
- `cargo test -p sir-conformance` green: the Ruby cells run every v0-accepted
  corpus program and match the reference oracle byte-for-byte.
