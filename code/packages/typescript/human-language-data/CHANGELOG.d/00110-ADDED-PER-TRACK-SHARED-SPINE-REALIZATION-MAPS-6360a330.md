### Added — per-track shared-spine realization maps

- Load and validate one ordered `curriculum.json` for every registered track,
  with repeatable spine segments, explicit omission/relocation ledgers, and
  typed language-specific extensions placed before, inline, or after a segment.
- Require canonical and schema-v2 lesson coverage, prerequisite-closed local
  order, and exact support-lesson extension classification across all 20 maps.
- Add pure local-path and independent mixed-frontier queries so downstream apps
  can schedule the next safe lesson without borrowing another language's
  progress.
