## Chapter 1 — Greetings (Malayalam script taught inline)

- New Malayalam track on the HL00 framework — the last of the four Dravidian
  tracks. One word per lesson, slug ids, atom-first, derivations shown, LaTeX
  book. Uses the **vendored** Noto Sans Malayalam font (relative `Path=`, shaped
  via `Script=Malayalam`, no polyglossia language module needed).
- **No reading course.** Per `HL00`'s inline-letters rule, Malayalam is taught
  *inside* each word lesson.
- Chapter 1 (`lessons/ML-C01-*`), greetings + conversational glue:
  - **നമസ്കാരം** namaskāram ("hello," **Sanskrit** namas + kāra) — inherent
    *a*, vowel signs, the chandrakkala, the സ്ക conjunct, anusvāram ം.
  - **നന്ദി** nandi ("thanks," **native**, root *nal*) — the twin of Tamil
    *naṉṟi*; the ന്ദ conjunct.
  - **അതെ** athe ("yes," native, "that [is so]") — yes/no as demonstratives;
    the *e*-sign written before its consonant.
  - **ഇല്ല** illa ("no / isn't," native, root *il*) — the twin of Tamil
    *illai*; negation by a negative existential verb.
  - **ശരി** śari ("okay," native) — the family word *sari* with Sanskrit ശ.
  - **practice** — recap + the *pōyi varām* farewell (nearly the same words as
    Tamil's *pōy varugiṟēṉ*).
- The recurring thread: **Malayalam is Tamil's closest sister** — four of the
  five everyday words are shared with Tamil (nandi, athe, illa, śari) — **with a
  heavy Sanskrit overlay** (namaskāram; the largest alphabet in the family).
  Each lesson carries an "Across the family" cognate box (English / Sanskrit /
  Hindi / Tamil / Kannada / Telugu), every form supplied so nothing is assumed.
  Book compiles clean with XeLaTeX. Completes the four Dravidian first chapters.
