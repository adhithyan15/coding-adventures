# CLOC12 — Upstream port gaps

> Status: tracking list. Seeded by CLOC12.01 with no entries.
> Populated as ported upstream tests get marked `#[ignore]`.

## Numbering

Every gap gets a `gap-NNN` ID, allocated in order. Once allocated, an
ID is never reused — even when the gap closes, the entry stays for
historical context with status `RESOLVED` and a link to the fix PR.

## Entries

### gap-001 — typed AST lacks `undefined` / `NaN` / `Infinity` literal-equivalents

- **Status:** PARTIALLY RESOLVED in CLOC12.16 — `UndefinedLiteral` is now in the AST. `NaN` and `Infinity` remain open (tracked under a follow-up since they're `Identifier { name: "NaN"/"Infinity" }` resolutions, not new literal nodes).
- **Upstream test:** `PeepholeFoldConstantsTest::testUndefinedComparison1`
- **Ported file:** `closure-pass-constant-fold/tests/upstream/peephole_fold_constants_test.rs`
- **Resolution note:** CLOC12.16 adds `UndefinedLiteral { cv: Option<CvId> }` to `javascript-ast`. The closure-emitter writes it as `void 0` (shadow-safe — `undefined` is a writable identifier in non-strict mode, but `void <expr>` always produces the genuine undefined value). The closure-pass-constant-fold gained three new arms: leaf passthrough, `js_literal_type` → `"undefined"`, and `typeof <UndefinedLiteral>` → `"undefined"` (closes the last hole in CLOC12.09's typeof table). The cross-type strict-equality fold also automatically picks up undefined vs other types because `js_literal_type` produces a distinct tag for it.

### gap-002 — constant-fold doesn't treat `void 0` as `undefined`

- **Status:** RESOLVED in CLOC12.20 — `UnaryOperator::Void` over a primitive literal now folds to `UndefinedLiteral`. `closure-pass-constant-fold 0.8.0` adds the `Void` arm in `fold_unary` and the `FoldedLiteral::Undefined` variant; `test_undefined_comparison_2` is un-ignored.
- **Upstream test:** `PeepholeFoldConstantsTest::testUndefinedComparison2`
- **Ported file:** `closure-pass-constant-fold/tests/upstream/peephole_fold_constants_test.rs`
- **Why it failed:** `void 0` is `UnaryExpression { operator: Void, argument: NumericLiteral(0) }` in our typed AST. Upstream folds it to `undefined`, which then participates in equality folds. We needed both gap-001 first (UndefinedLiteral variant, closed in CLOC12.16) and a `void <literal>` → `undefined` fold rule (this PR).
- **What it needed:** A unary-`void`-of-literal fold rule plus the `undefined` literal from gap-001. Both shipped.

### gap-003 — cross-type `null == x` fold not implemented

- **Status:** RESOLVED in CLOC12.21 — `try_fold_binary_op` now implements the `null`-side branch of ECMAScript §IsLooselyEqual for compile-time-known partner literals. `null == X` (or `X == null`) folds to `true` iff `X` is `null` (the existing gap-007 branch, untouched) or `undefined`; every other primitive-literal partner (`number`, `string`, `boolean`, `bigint`) folds to `false`. `!=` is the boolean negation. Identifier-on-other-side bails out — the runtime value could itself be null/undefined, and folding to a concrete boolean would be unsound. `test_null_comparison_1_loose_against_other_types` is un-ignored. Inline tests cover both directions (left/right swap of null), the `!=` complement, the `null == undefined → true` special case (both directions), the unsoundness guard against identifiers, and a regression check that gap-008's strict-equality cross-type branch still fires.

### gap-004 — abstract-equality and abstract-comparison folds across Number/String

- **Status:** RESOLVED in CLOC12.22 — `try_fold_binary_op` now coerces a String operand against a Number operand via a conservative subset of §StringToNumber (`js_string_to_number_strict`) and evaluates the resulting Number-vs-Number comparison for `==` / `!=` / `<` / `<=` / `>` / `>=`. Order is preserved: `'2' < 1` still folds to `false` (NOT swapped to `1 < 2`). Operates on both directions (Number-on-left and String-on-left). Strict `===` / `!==` is unaffected — gap-008's cross-type branch already handles those and is statically unreachable from this branch's operator guard. The string→number helper recognises the empty/whitespace string, decimal literals (with optional sign, `.`, and `[eE][+-]?` exponent), and the explicit `Infinity` / `+Infinity` / `-Infinity` forms; it deliberately *bails* on hex/binary/octal prefixes, lone signs/dots, non-ASCII whitespace, and unrecognised text — those are sound follow-ups that can be added without re-deriving the rules. `test_number_string_comparison_literal_lines` is un-ignored.
- **Upstream test:** `PeepholeFoldConstantsTest::testNumberStringComparison`, `PeepholeFoldConstantsTest::testStringNumberComparison`
- **Ported file:** `closure-pass-constant-fold/tests/upstream/peephole_fold_constants_test.rs`

### gap-005 — `typeof` operator constant-fold not implemented

- **Status:** RESOLVED in CLOC12.09 (literal-typeof cases) — residual identity-fold tracked as gap-029
- **Upstream test:** `PeepholeFoldConstantsTest::testStringStringComparison` (lines using `typeof`)
- **Ported file:** `closure-pass-constant-fold/tests/upstream/peephole_fold_constants_test.rs`
- **Resolution:** Added a `UnaryOperator::TypeOf` branch to `fold_unary` that pattern-matches the argument against the four Phase 1 primitive literals and returns the corresponding string: `NumericLiteral → "number"`, `StringLiteral → "string"`, `BooleanLiteral → "boolean"`, `NullLiteral → "object"` (the JS quirk). The remaining cases (`undefined`, BigInt, function expression, identifier) stay deferred per their respective gaps (gap-001, gap-021, Phase 1.x AST, runtime-unknown). The identity-comparison fold (`typeof x === typeof x` → `true`) is conceptually different — see gap-029.

### gap-007 — `NullLiteral OP NullLiteral` fold not implemented

- **Status:** RESOLVED in CLOC12.03 (PR pending)
- **Upstream test:** `PeepholeFoldConstantsTest::testNullComparison1` (`null OP null` self-relation lines)
- **Ported file:** `closure-pass-constant-fold/tests/upstream/peephole_fold_constants_test.rs`
- **Resolution:** Added a `NullLiteral`/`NullLiteral` branch in `try_fold_binary_op` returning `Boolean(true)` for `==`/`===`/`<=`/`>=` and `Boolean(false)` for `!=`/`!==`/`<`/`>`. Relational ops follow ECMAScript §IsLessThan with `ToNumber(null) = 0`.

### gap-008 — cross-type strict equality fold (`Number === String → false`)

- **Status:** RESOLVED in CLOC12.03 (PR pending)
- **Upstream test:** `PeepholeFoldConstantsTest::testNumberStringComparison` (`===`/`!==` lines)
- **Ported file:** `closure-pass-constant-fold/tests/upstream/peephole_fold_constants_test.rs`
- **Resolution:** Added a strict-equality-cross-type branch in `try_fold_binary_op` that fires after the same-type branches. Uses a new internal helper `js_literal_type` to tag each Phase 1 primitive literal with a discriminator (`"number"`/`"string"`/`"boolean"`/`"null"`); when both sides are tagged and tags differ, `===` → `false`, `!==` → `true`. Loose `==` is still untouched (gap-003/gap-004).

### gap-006 — unary plus / minus on identifiers, plus identifier-arithmetic shape

- **Status:** RESOLVED in CLOC12.23 — pure test-only port; no production code changed. The pass already declines to fold `+<identifier>` / `-<identifier>` in `fold_unary` (runtime value is unknown), and the surrounding `try_fold_binary_op` declines whenever either side isn't a recognised literal. The new `test_same_unary_on_identifier_in_comparison` test in `peephole_fold_constants_test.rs` pins the upstream `testSame("+x > +y")` / `testSame("+x == +y")` lines plus several adjacent shapes: `+x === +y`, `-x < -y` (Negate variant), asymmetric `0 < +x`, and `+x == +x` (same identifier on both sides — must NOT fold because `x` could be NaN at runtime).
- **Upstream test:** `PeepholeFoldConstantsTest::testNumberNumberComparison` (`+x > +y` `testSame` lines)
- **Ported file:** `closure-pass-constant-fold/tests/upstream/peephole_fold_constants_test.rs`

### gap-009 — `LabeledStatement` / `BreakStatement` not modelled in Phase 1 AST

- **Status:** RESOLVED in CLOC12.13 (AST modelled; `testRemoveNoOpLabelledStatement` now exercises real nodes). Residual: the actual *collapse* of `a: break a;` to empty is its own follow-up gap (tracked in-test).
- **Upstream test:** `PeepholeRemoveDeadCodeTest::testRemoveNoOpLabelledStatement`, `testRemoveUselessLabelWithFollowingBreak`
- **Ported file:** `closure-pass-dce/tests/upstream/peephole_remove_dead_code_test.rs`
- **Resolution note:** `BreakStatement` was already modelled in the original Phase 1 implementation; `LabeledStatement` was the missing piece. CLOC12.13 adds `LabeledStatement { label: Identifier, body: Box<Statement>, cv }` to `javascript-ast`, wires it through constant-fold / fold-control-flow / DCE (passthrough — recurse into body, label preserved), and teaches `closure-emitter` to print `label:body`. The test stub was un-ignored and rewritten to build the `a: break a;` AST by hand and assert the pipeline preserves it verbatim (which is the *current* behaviour). When the collapse optimisation lands the assertion flips from `assert_dce_same` → `assert_dce_yields(..., vec![])`.

### gap-010 — block-flattening (single-child block collapse) not implemented

- **Status:** RESOLVED in CLOC12.19 (PR pending).
- **Upstream test:** `PeepholeRemoveDeadCodeTest::testFoldBlock` (block-flattening lines)
- **Ported file:** `closure-pass-dce/tests/upstream/peephole_remove_dead_code_test.rs`
- **Resolution note:** Added a flatten step at the top of `dce_block_statement` (after the recurse pass, before dead-after-terminator and EmptyStatement drops). For each direct-child statement, if it's a `BlockStatement` AND a new `block_is_scope_safe_to_flatten` helper returns true (i.e., contains no `let`/`const`/`class`/`function` declarations), splice its body into the enclosing block. `var` is fine because it's function-scoped. Cascades cleanly with the existing dead-code drops: `{x;{return;y;};z;}` → `{x;return;}` in one pass. `test_fold_block_flattening` un-ignored with four assertions; existing `recurses_into_nested_blocks` updated to reflect the new behaviour.

### gap-011 — `if`-with-constant-test collapse lives in `fold-control-flow`, not DCE

- **Status:** RESOLVED in CLOC12.06 — behaviour covered via CLOC12.05 (PR #4672)
- **Upstream test:** `PeepholeRemoveDeadCodeTest::testIf`, `testHook` (`if`/ternary constant-test lines)
- **Ported file (original site):** `closure-pass-dce/tests/upstream/peephole_remove_dead_code_test.rs`
- **Where the behaviour actually lives now:** `closure-pass-fold-control-flow/tests/upstream/peephole_minimize_conditions_test.rs` — `test_if_true_folds_to_consequent`, `test_if_false_folds_to_alternate`, `test_if_false_no_alternate_becomes_empty_statement`, `test_if_numeric_one_folds_to_consequent`, `test_if_numeric_zero_folds_to_alternate`, `test_if_nonempty_string_folds_to_consequent`, `test_if_empty_string_folds_to_alternate`, `test_if_null_folds_to_alternate` (the last one is the exact line upstream `testIf` has for `if(null){…}else{…}` → alternate).
- **Resolution note:** The DCE-side test stub (`test_if_with_constant_test_collapse`) was changed from `#[ignore]` to a tiny non-ignored marker that documents the cross-crate routing for future readers. Behavioural coverage stays in fold-control-flow where it belongs.

### gap-012 — `ConditionalExpression` cleanup lives in `constant-fold`, not DCE

- **Status:** RESOLVED in CLOC12.27 — the upstream `testHook` test was re-routed to `closure-pass-constant-fold/tests/upstream/peephole_fold_constants_test.rs::test_hook_ternary_cleanup_sequence_dependent` (an `#[ignore]`-d stub), and the DCE port file's `test_hook_cleanup` was reannotated to point at the new home. The literal-test ternary cases (`true ? c : a` → `c`, `false ? c : a` → `a`) are already covered by `fold_conditional` + `literal_truthy` in the constant-fold crate's inline tests. The SequenceExpression-dependent rewrites (`a ? X : X` → `(a, X)`) are *not* a fold-rule gap but a Phase 1.x AST gap — they require `javascript-ast` to grow a `SequenceExpression` variant before they can be represented, let alone folded. Tracked separately under "needs SequenceExpression" — *not* under any CLOC12 gap-NNN entry, because the missing piece is a primary AST node rather than a constant-fold rule.
- **Upstream test:** `PeepholeRemoveDeadCodeTest::testHook` (`a ? b : c` cleanup)
- **Ported file:** `closure-pass-constant-fold/tests/upstream/peephole_fold_constants_test.rs` (re-routed in CLOC12.27); the original DCE port file points to the new home via a doc comment.

### gap-013 — useless-loop-body folding not in DCE

- **Status:** RESOLVED in CLOC12.28 — the upstream `testFoldUselessFor` / `testFoldUselessDo` / `testFoldEmptyDo` / `testMinimizeLoop_*` tests were re-routed to `closure-pass-fold-control-flow/tests/upstream/peephole_minimize_conditions_test.rs::test_fold_useless_loop_body_routing` (an `#[ignore]`-d stub) and the DCE port file's `test_fold_useless_loop_body` was reannotated to point at the new home. The literal-test loop-collapse cases (`while(false) { ... }` → `;`) are already covered by `fold_while_statement` + `literal_truthy` in the fold-control-flow crate's inline tests. The body-pure-no-effects rewrites (`while(x){pure(...)}` → `while(x);`) are *not* a fold-rule gap but an effect-analysis gap — they require a pass that can prove "this statement has no observable side effects" before the body can be dropped. Tracked separately as a future "effect analysis" gap, *not* under any CLOC12 gap-NNN entry, because the missing piece is a primary analysis rather than a fold rule.
- **Upstream test:** `PeepholeRemoveDeadCodeTest::testFoldUselessFor`, `testFoldUselessDo`, `testFoldEmptyDo`, `testMinimizeLoop_*`
- **Ported file:** `closure-pass-fold-control-flow/tests/upstream/peephole_minimize_conditions_test.rs` (re-routed in CLOC12.28); the original DCE port file points to the new home via a doc comment.

### gap-014 — `SwitchStatement` not in Phase 1 AST

- **Status:** **RESOLVED**. AST + emitter in CLOC12.33; empty-switch elimination in CLOC12.34 (closure-pass-dce 0.6.0); drop-after-break in CLOC12.35 (0.7.0); constant-discriminant collapse in CLOC12.36 (0.8.0 — strict-equality match against pure-leaf-literal discriminant + tests, trailing-break strip, fallback to default, conservative bail on fall-through or NaN). The fall-through-aware multi-case concatenation variant is the only remaining elaboration and is tracked as a future polish rather than a gap.
- **Upstream test:** `PeepholeRemoveDeadCodeTest::testOptimizeSwitch*` (a dozen tests)
- **Ported file:** `closure-pass-dce/tests/upstream/peephole_remove_dead_code_test.rs`
- **Resolution note:** CLOC12.33 adds `SwitchStatement { cv, discriminant, cases }` and `SwitchCase { cv, test: Option<Expression>, consequent: Vec<Statement> }` to `javascript-ast`, plus the `TaggedStatement::SwitchStatement` arm and `Statement::switch_statement` convenience constructor. The closure-emitter learns `emit_switch` / `emit_switch_case` covering both compact and pretty modes (compact `switch(x){case 1:y;default:z;}`, pretty indented). DCE / fold-control-flow / constant-fold / scope-analyzer each gained a passthrough match arm that recurses into the discriminant, each case's test, and each consequent statement — no peephole rules yet. The structural prerequisite is in place; the per-test arms (empty-switch removal, etc.) land in CLOC12.34+ as separate slices. `BreakStatement` was already in the AST (CLOC12.13).

### gap-015 — `var` / `let` / `const` lifting and hoisting

- **Status:** RESOLVED in CLOC12.37 — var-hoisting landed in `closure-pass-fold-control-flow 0.8.0` as a post-step inside the `Declaration::FunctionDeclaration` arm. After the body folds, `var x = expr;` declarations nested in blocks / ifs / whiles / fors / labels / switch-cases lift to a single prepended `var x, y, z;` at the function-body top, with `x = expr;` assignment-statements remaining at the original sites. `let` and `const` (block-scoped per spec) stay put — the spec-correct behaviour, the gap title was misleading. The upstream "let/const lifting" optimisations are about removing redundant bindings; when those come up they'll route through `closure-pass-remove-unused-vars` (CLOC13.E), not here.
- **Upstream test:** `PeepholeRemoveDeadCodeTest::testVarLifting`, `testLetConstLifting*`
- **Ported file:** `closure-pass-dce/tests/upstream/peephole_remove_dead_code_test.rs`

### gap-016 — `if (x) S` → `x && S` rewrite not implemented

- **Status:** RESOLVED in CLOC12.24 — `fold_if_statement` now has a third (after the literal-truthy/falsy and gap-017 if-else→ternary branches): when `alternate.is_none()` AND the consequent reduces to a single `ExpressionStatement` (directly or via `single_expr_stmt`'s BlockStatement unwrap), the IfStatement is rewritten to `ExpressionStatement { LogicalExpression { left: test, op: And, right: consequent_expr } }`. Side-effect semantics are preserved: `&&` evaluates `test` first and the right operand only when `test` is truthy — exactly matching `if (test) S`'s observable behaviour. The rule does NOT fire when an alternate is present (preventing silent loss of the else branch) and does NOT fire when the consequent is multi-statement (no single right-hand expression to lower into). `test_fold_one_child_blocks_if_to_logical_and` is un-ignored. Two pre-existing inline tests were updated to reflect the new behaviour: `if_non_literal_test_with_no_alternate_passes_through` → `..._with_multi_statement_consequent_passes_through` (uses a 2-statement block that still can't fold), and `if_with_unresolved_comparison_doesnt_fold_alone` → `..._folds_via_gap016` (now expects the `(1<2) && A` shape and asserts the inner `1 < 2` survived as a BinaryExpression — confirming fold-control-flow still doesn't fold binary comparisons).
- **Upstream test:** `PeepholeMinimizeConditionsTest::testFoldOneChildBlocks` (`if(x) foo()` → `x&&foo()` lines)
- **Ported file:** `closure-pass-fold-control-flow/tests/upstream/peephole_minimize_conditions_test.rs`

### gap-017 — `if (x) C else A` → `x ? C : A` rewrite not implemented

- **Status:** RESOLVED in CLOC12.18 (PR pending).
- **Upstream test:** `PeepholeMinimizeConditionsTest::testFoldOneChildBlocks` (`if(x){foo()}else{bar()}` → `x?foo():bar()` lines)
- **Ported file:** `closure-pass-fold-control-flow/tests/upstream/peephole_minimize_conditions_test.rs`
- **Resolution note:** Added a rewrite arm in `fold_if_statement` that fires when the test isn't a literal AND both branches reduce to a single `ExpressionStatement` (recursively unwrapping single-statement `BlockStatement` layers via a `single_expr_stmt` helper). Emits an `ExpressionStatement` wrapping a `ConditionalExpression`. Side-effect-safe because ternary preserves the same evaluation order as if-else (test first, then exactly one branch). `test_fold_one_child_blocks_if_else_to_ternary` un-ignored.

### gap-018 — De Morgan / negation-swap rewrites not implemented

- **Status:** RESOLVED in CLOC12.25 — both `fold_if_statement` and `fold_conditional` now strip a top-level `!` from the test and swap consequent / alternate. The IfStatement case is gated on `alternate.is_some()` (when no alternate is present, gap-016's `!x && S` form is the better rewrite); the ConditionalExpression case has no guard because ternaries always have both arms. The unary's argument is moved (not cloned) into the new test position, so no second runtime evaluation of `<inner>` is introduced. Position: runs BEFORE `literal_truthy` resolution so the swapped tests can pick up literal folds in the same iteration. `test_fold_conditional_de_morgan` is un-ignored — input `if (!a) { foo() } else { bar() }` now folds through gap-018 swap → gap-017 ternary to `a ? bar() : foo();`.
- **Upstream test:** `PeepholeMinimizeConditionsTest::testFoldConditionalDeMorgan`
- **Ported file:** `closure-pass-fold-control-flow/tests/upstream/peephole_minimize_conditions_test.rs`

### gap-019 — return-then-return through `if-else` → ternary return

- **Status:** RESOLVED in CLOC12.26 — `fold_if_statement` now has a fourth rewriting branch (after gap-018 swap, literal_truthy, gap-017 ternary, and now gap-019 — gap-016 stays after, gated on no alternate). When both branches reduce to a single `ReturnStatement` whose `argument` is `Some` (recursing through single-statement `BlockStatement` layers via the new `single_return_with_arg` helper), the IfStatement is replaced with `return test ? E1 : E2;`. The conservative `Some`-on-both-sides guard skips the `return;` (no argument) case — synthesising an `undefined` expression for it requires `UndefinedLiteral` plumbing in this pass and is tracked separately. `test_fold_returns_into_ternary` un-ignored. Composes with the gap-018 De Morgan swap so `if (!x) return E1; else return E2;` → (gap-018) `if (x) return E2; else return E1;` → (gap-019) `return x ? E2 : E1;`.
- **Upstream test:** `PeepholeMinimizeConditionsTest::testFoldReturns`
- **Ported file:** `closure-pass-fold-control-flow/tests/upstream/peephole_minimize_conditions_test.rs`

### gap-020 — `ThrowStatement` not in Phase 1 AST

- **Status:** RESOLVED in CLOC12.14 (AST modelled). Residual: the actual *rewriting* of `if (x) foo(); else throw e;` → `if (!x) throw e; foo();` is a follow-up; modelling the node is the structural prerequisite.
- **Upstream test:** `PeepholeMinimizeConditionsTest::testMinimizeIfWithThrow`
- **Ported file:** `closure-pass-fold-control-flow/tests/upstream/peephole_minimize_conditions_test.rs`
- **Resolution note:** CLOC12.14 adds `ThrowStatement { cv: Option<CvId>, argument: Expression }` to `javascript-ast` (argument non-optional per ECMAScript §13.14 — `throw;` is a SyntaxError). Wires it through `closure-emitter` (`throw expr;` with required whitespace between keyword and expression) and through all three rewriting passes (constant-fold, fold-control-flow, DCE — each folds the argument expression and preserves throw semantics; dead-after-throw collapse and the if-else early-throw rearrangement are separate follow-ups).

### gap-021 — `BigIntLiteral` not in Phase 1 AST

- **Status:** RESOLVED in CLOC12.15 (AST modelled; emitter writes the literal verbatim; `typeof <BigIntLiteral>` folds to `"bigint"` in constant-fold).
- **Upstream test:** `CodePrinterTest::testBigInt`
- **Ported file:** `closure-emitter/tests/upstream/code_printer_test.rs`
- **Resolution note:** CLOC12.15 adds `BigIntLiteral { cv: Option<CvId>, value: String, raw: String }` to `javascript-ast`. Per ESTree's JSON-safety convention `value` is the decimal expansion as a string (bigints can exceed `f64` range); `raw` keeps the source representation (including the trailing `n` and the source radix). The emitter writes `raw` verbatim — preserving hex/octal/binary radixes — because there is no shorter equivalent form for bigints (no exponential bigint syntax exists in JS). Negative bigints (`-5n`) are a `UnaryExpression` over a `BigIntLiteral`, never part of the literal itself. Bigint arithmetic folding (`1n + 2n → 3n`) is **not** implemented — would require a bigint runtime in the constant-fold pass; tracked as a follow-up gap. The `typeof <BigIntLiteral>` → `"bigint"` fold IS implemented since it requires no arithmetic.

### gap-022 — Array/object trailing-comma policy not modelled

- **Status:** RESOLVED in CLOC12.32. **What the gap actually needed**: a focused port file demonstrating that our emitter never emits a trailing comma before `]` or `}` in either compact or pretty mode. Upstream's `assertPrettyPrint("var x = [1,];", "var x = [1];\n")` family relies on the parse step stripping the trailing comma (it's purely syntactic in ES2017, NOT an elision) and the emitter simply never writing one. Our `ArrayExpression.elements: Vec<Option<Expression>>` doesn't preserve trailing-comma input — a parsed `[1,]` collapses to `[Some(1)]`, identical to `[1]`. So the `trailing_comma: bool` AST flag the original gap entry asked for is unnecessary; the output-side invariant is what matters, and the emitter already obeys it. 16 hand-built ports in `closure-emitter/tests/upstream/code_printer_trailing_comma_test.rs` pin the array/object/nested cases in both compact and pretty modes, plus the "elision is NOT a trailing comma" edge case.
- **Upstream test:** `CodePrinterTest::testTrailingCommaInArrayAndObjectWithPrettyPrint` and ~6 sibling tests
- **Ported file:** `closure-emitter/tests/upstream/code_printer_trailing_comma_test.rs` (new home); placeholder in `closure-emitter/tests/upstream/code_printer_test.rs` re-annotated to point at the new file.

### gap-023 — `VariableDeclaration` round-trip ports deferred

- **Status:** RESOLVED in CLOC12.30 — landed the focused declarations port file at `closure-emitter/tests/upstream/code_printer_declarations_test.rs` with 14 hand-built ports covering var/let/const, bare vs. with-init, single vs. multi-declarator, and the canonical `var x = [];` / `var x = [1];` / `var x = [1, 2, 3];` shapes (which also covers upstream's `testNoTrailingCommaInEmptyArrayLiteral` from the original code-printer port file). The original stub in `code_printer_test.rs` is reannotated to point at the new home. Verbosity is contained to one file behind two small helpers (`var_decl_single` / `var_decl_multi`). One pin documents existing emitter behaviour where it diverges from upstream's compact form (`a + b` vs `a+b` around binary `+`) — that style-policy delta is its own follow-up and not part of this gap.
- **Upstream test:** Most `assertPrintSame("var x = …")` lines in `CodePrinterTest`
- **Ported file:** `closure-emitter/tests/upstream/code_printer_declarations_test.rs`

### gap-024 — `ExpressionStatement` paren-wrapping diverges from upstream

- **Status:** RESOLVED in CLOC12.10
- **Upstream test:** Every upstream `assertPrintSame("foo();")` / `assertPrint("a+b", "a+b")` line
- **Ported file:** `closure-emitter/tests/upstream/code_printer_test.rs`
- **Resolution:** Added a precedence ladder (`PREC_PRIMARY`, `PREC_UNARY`, `PREC_CONDITIONAL`, `PREC_ASSIGNMENT`, plus per-operator `binary_prec` / `logical_prec` / `expr_prec`) and a `emit_expression_inner(e, parent_prec)` helper that wraps in parens only when the child's own precedence is strictly less than the parent context's. Statement position uses `parent_prec = 0`, so primary / call / member / binary / etc. emit without outer parens. The leading-token disambiguation wrap stays in place for `ObjectExpression` at statement position. The two `_is_current_behaviour` ports got their assertions flipped to upstream-byte-identical forms (`"2 + 3;"`, `"\"a\" + \"b\";"`). Three inline tests also flipped.

### gap-025 — Numeric formatting (shortest-form / exponential) not implemented

- **Status:** RESOLVED in CLOC12.12
- **Upstream test:** `CodePrinterTest` lines like `assertPrint("1000000000", "1E9")`
- **Ported file:** `closure-emitter/tests/upstream/code_printer_test.rs`
- **Resolution:** `format_js_number` now computes both decimal and exponential forms for finite non-zero numbers and returns the shorter (ties → decimal). `format_exponential_uppercase` wraps Rust's `{:e}` formatter and uppercases the `e`. Examples: `1000000000` → `1E9`, `5000000` → `5E6`, `1.5e-10` → `1.5E-10`. Small integers and decimals stay decimal. NaN/Infinity unchanged. The `test_number_formatting_shortest_form` ignored placeholder in `tests/upstream/code_printer_test.rs` stays — to be re-port'd with real upstream `assertPrint` lines in a follow-up; the underlying emitter behaviour is in place.

### gap-026 — String quote-choice optimisation not implemented

- **Status:** RESOLVED in CLOC12.11
- **Upstream test:** `CodePrinterTest` quote-choice lines
- **Ported file:** `closure-emitter/tests/upstream/code_printer_test.rs`
- **Resolution:** Added `choose_quote_and_escape(value)` + `escape_str_sq` helpers in `closure-emitter/src/lib.rs`. `emit_string` now picks single-quote when value contains strictly more `"` than `'` (each saved `\"` is one fewer escape); double-quote otherwise (canonical, ties picked toward double). `ascii_only` mode still always uses double — that's upstream's own invariant. Six new inline tests cover all branches. The `test_string_quote_choice_minimises_escapes` ignored placeholder in the upstream port file will be re-port'd with real upstream `assertPrint` cases in a follow-up.

### gap-027 — Precedence-aware paren insertion not implemented

- **Status:** RESOLVED in CLOC12.10 (incidental, via the same fix as gap-024)
- **Upstream test:** `CodePrinterTest` operator-precedence lines (e.g. `a*(b+c)` keeps inner parens)
- **Ported file:** `closure-emitter/tests/upstream/code_printer_test.rs`
- **Resolution:** The precedence ladder added for gap-024 covers this directly. `emit_expression_inner(e, parent_prec)` checks `expr_prec(e) < parent_prec` and inserts parens when so — which means `a * (b + c)` correctly keeps the inner parens because `+` (prec 11) < `*` (prec 12). The `test_operator_precedence_inserts_inner_parens` ignored placeholder will be re-port'd with real upstream test cases in a follow-up; the emitter machinery is already in place.

### gap-028 — VLQ encoder for source-map `mappings` field not implemented

- **Status:** RESOLVED in CLOC12.29 + CLOC12.31. **Step 1** (CLOC12.29) shipped the base64-VLQ primitives (`encode_vlq_int` / `encode_vlq_segment`) cross-checked against Mozilla's `source-map`, Google's `Base64VLQ.java`, and the v3 worked examples. **Step 2** (CLOC12.31) wires the primitives into `SourceMapBuilder::build()`: each pending `(generated_line, generated_column, cv_id)` is resolved to `(source_index, original_line, original_column)` via the `CVLog` — looking up the entry's own `Origin` first, then walking `parent_ids` depth-first with a cycle guard. `Origin.location` is parsed as `"line:col"`; non-matching free-form locations (e.g. `"row_id:N"`) fall through to the 1-field segment shape. The `sources` list is populated in first-seen order; `names` stays empty (5-field segments need a per-mapping name hint the emitter doesn't currently surface). The delta-encoded `mappings` string uses `;` between lines (with `generated_column` reset) and `,` between segments on the same line; leading semicolons cover the gap from line 0 to the first mapped line. 12 new inline tests pin: single 4-field segment, same-line delta encoding, multi-line `;` separators, two-source first-seen indexing, unresolved 1-field fallback, mixed resolved + unresolved, parent-chain origin lookup, defensive sort of out-of-order input, unparseable `location`, leading-`;` first-mapping-on-later-line, empty builder, self-referential cycle.
- **Upstream test:** `SourceMapGeneratorV3Test::testBasicMapping*`, `testLiteralMappings*`, `testMultilineMapping*`, `testMultiFunctionMapping`, `testGoldenOutput*` (almost the entire upstream file)
- **Ported file:** `closure-source-map/tests/upstream/source_map_generator_v3_test.rs`
- **Remaining:** The 7 `#[ignore]`-d upstream ports stay ignored. They exercise the full Closure-compiler pipeline (`compileAndCheck` driving `lex → parse → emit → source-map generate`) and assert against specific Closure-byte-identical VLQ strings; reaching them needs the closurec end-to-end harness plus golden capture from upstream. Tracked under CLOC14.1.

### gap-029 — identity-of-typeof-same-identifier fold not implemented

- **Status:** RESOLVED in CLOC12.17 (PR pending).
- **Upstream test:** `PeepholeFoldConstantsTest::testStringStringComparison` (`typeof a === typeof a` lines)
- **Ported file:** `closure-pass-constant-fold/tests/upstream/peephole_fold_constants_test.rs`
- **Resolution note:** Added a new structural-equality arm in `try_fold_binary_op` for `StrictEq`/`StrictNotEq` operators where both sides are `UnaryExpression { op: TypeOf, argument: Identifier }` with the same identifier name. Folds to `true`/`false` respectively. Identifier-only because `typeof <undeclared>` is special-cased by ECMAScript §UnaryTypeofExpression to return `"undefined"` rather than throw, so the fold is safe even without declaration-tracking — `typeof x` evaluated twice deterministically produces the same string. Member/call expressions are deliberately NOT folded because they can have side effects that we can't prove are absent without a heavier purity analysis. `test_typeof_identifier_identity_fold` un-ignored.

### gap-030 — function-declaration semicolon ASI policy

- **Status:** **FULLY RESOLVED** by CLOC12.38 (AST emitter half — merged PR #5140) and CLOC12.39 (CLI WHITESPACE_ONLY token re-stitcher half, PR pending). The `minify_function_decl` seed fixture flipped from IGNORED to **PASS** in CLOC12.39: closurec now emits `function f(){return 1};\n` byte-for-byte identical to upstream Closure v20240317.
- **Upstream byte-identity test:** `minify_function_decl` seed fixture (in CLOC14 harness). PASS.
- **The two halves:**

  **A. AST emitter side (closure-emitter)** — **RESOLVED in CLOC12.38** (merged PR #5140).
  - `emit_block_statement` drops a trailing `;` before `}` via `pop_trailing_semi_if_compact()` (compact mode only), gated by `last_stmt_uses_terminator_semi` so EmptyStatement-body cases like `if(x);` survive.
  - `emit_function_declaration` emits `;` after the body's closing `}` in compact mode.
  - Pretty mode is intentionally untouched.

  **B. CLI WHITESPACE_ONLY token re-stitcher side (`closurec/src/whitespace_only.rs`)** — **RESOLVED in CLOC12.39.**
  - The closurec CLI uses a token-level re-stitcher (NOT closure-emitter) for WHITESPACE_ONLY. CLOC12.39 ports the same two rules to this layer:
    1. **Rule A — drop `;` token before `}`**: with a `body_position_next` guard that protects EmptyStatement body slots (`if(x);` / `while(x);` / `for(;;);`).
    2. **Rule B — emit `;` after `}` of a function DECLARATION body**: state machine tracks "saw `function` keyword at statement boundary" + a per-`{` brace stack flag.
    3. **Rule C — dedup**: source `;` immediately after a synthetic `;` (rule B) is dropped to avoid `};;` in output for shapes like `function f(){};var g=1;`.
  - 10 inline tests pin every rule + edge case (function-expression doesn't get trailing `;`, if/while/for body slots preserved, dedup works, multi-stmt drops only last `;`, top-level `var` unchanged).
  - The pre-existing `tests/diff/whitespace-only/expected.stdout` was updated — its hand-written golden predicted `function add(a,b){return a+b;}` (closurec's old shape), but upstream Closure actually emits `function add(a,b){return a+b};`. Re-captured from upstream JAR to match the now-correct output.

### gap-031 — empty `{}` body collapses to `;`

- **Status:** OPEN — newly discovered by CLOC14.3.
- **Upstream byte-identity test:** `minify_for_loop` seed fixture.
- **Why it fails:** Upstream Closure emits `for(...){}` as `for(...);` — the empty block body is replaced by an `EmptyStatement` (`;`). closurec preserves the `{}`.
  - Input: `for(var i=0;i<10;i++){}`
  - Upstream: `for(var i=0;i<10;i++);`
  - closurec: `for(var i=0;i<10;i++){}`
- **Applies to:** Empty `{}` in any control-flow body position: `for(...){}`, `while(x){}`, `if(x){}`, `if(x){}else{}` (each else position), `for(x in y){}`, `for(x of y){}`.
- **What it needs:** CLI token-state-machine extension. When `body_position_next` is true AND the next two tokens are `{` and `}` (in that order), emit `;` instead of `{}`. Pretty mode keeps `{}` for readability. Per-language, ECMAScript §13.4 (EmptyStatement) is exactly the substitution upstream is doing.

### gap-032 — single-statement if/else block flattening (CLI)

- **Status:** OPEN — newly discovered by CLOC14.3. **Counterpart to gap-010** (which closes the AST-level version via DCE block-flattening, resolved in CLOC12.19).
- **Upstream byte-identity test:** `minify_if_else` seed fixture.
- **Why it fails:** Upstream emits single-statement if/else bodies WITHOUT enclosing `{}`:
  - Input: `if(x){a();}else{b();}`
  - Upstream: `if(x)a();else b();`
  - closurec: `if(x){a()}else{b()}`
- **What it needs:** The AST-level pass (DCE block-flattening) does this transformation, but the CLI's WHITESPACE_ONLY path doesn't invoke the AST pipeline. Either: (a) route WHITESPACE_ONLY through a minimal AST → emit cycle for this rule, OR (b) add a CLI-only token-level "drop `{}` around single-stmt body" rule, OR (c) accept that WHITESPACE_ONLY's mandate is "preserve source statement shape" and this is upstream over-stepping its level (Closure does this anyway under WHITESPACE_ONLY — verified). Option (a) is the path-of-least-divergence and most pipeline-aligned.

### gap-033 — try/catch trailing `;` after `}`

- **Status:** **RESOLVED** in CLOC12.40 (PR pending). `minify_try_catch` flipped IGNORED → PASS.
- **Upstream byte-identity test:** `minify_try_catch` seed fixture. PASS.
- **Why it failed:** Upstream emits a `;` after the last `}` of a try/catch statement, mirroring its function-decl normalisation. closurec correctly dropped inner `;`s per gap-030 rule A but never emitted the trailing `;`.
- **Resolution:** Extended the CLI token state machine. `brace_stack` was refactored from `Vec<bool>` to `Vec<BlockKind>` with three variants: `Function`, `TryChain`, `Other`. A new flag `next_block_is_try_chain` is armed by the `try`/`catch`/`finally` keywords; the next `{` consumes it and pushes `BlockKind::TryChain` onto the stack. When a `}` pops a `TryChain` kind, the emitter peeks the next non-trivia token: if it's `catch` or `finally`, the chain continues and no `;` is emitted; otherwise the chain has ended and a synthetic `;` is appended. 6 inline tests pin the behavior including nested try/catch, try/catch/finally chains, function-decl inside try-block (no interference between Function and TryChain), and ES2019 optional catch binding (`try{a;}catch{b;}`).
