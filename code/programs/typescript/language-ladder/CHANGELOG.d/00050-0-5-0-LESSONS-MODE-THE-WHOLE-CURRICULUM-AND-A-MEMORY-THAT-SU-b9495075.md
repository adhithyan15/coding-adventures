## 0.5.0 — Lessons mode: the whole curriculum, and a memory that survives reloads

The app could already schedule you. It could not **remember** you, and it had
never read a single lesson. Both are fixed.

- **New "Lessons" mode** drills the **written curriculum** — all **679 lessons
  across 18 languages** — instead of only script letters. It reads them from
  `@coding-adventures/human-language-data`, the package that has always shipped
  `frontmatter.ts` / `loader.ts` / `parse.ts` / `queries.ts` for exactly this
  purpose and had **zero consumers** until now.
- **Progress now persists** (`src/progress.ts`). Previously there was no storage
  layer at all, so every Leitner box reset on reload and nothing was ever really
  "tracked". State is saved to `localStorage` keyed by **lesson id**, never by
  array index — indices shift every time a lesson is added, and saving by
  position would silently reattribute your progress to the wrong lesson. Adding
  a lesson now simply means one more unseen item.
- **Cross-language interleaving comes free.** `interleave.buildPool` already
  round-robins across groups for scripts; grouping lessons by language and
  feeding it the same way yields Arabic → Bengali → French → German → Gujarati →
  Hindi in consecutive reviews. A **rotating cursor** walks that order, which
  also fixes the obvious failure mode: box 0/1 fall due again after one session,
  so a scan-from-the-front picker would hand you the lesson you just answered,
  forever.
- **`scheduler.ts`, `interleave.ts` and `drill.ts` are unchanged.** They are
  generic over a numeric index and never needed to know what an item is — which
  is precisely why lessons could reuse them. The new *logic* is pure and tested
  (`lessons.ts`, `progress.ts`, including the `nextDue` cursor scan); the only
  impure edges are a tiny `StorageLike` port and `main.ts`'s DOM shell, which
  remains untested as before.
- **Defensive loading.** Saved state is untrusted input (hand-edited,
  half-written by another tab, left over from an older build). Every field is
  validated, unknown ids are treated as fresh, `__proto__`/`constructor` keys are
  skipped, the item map is `Object.create(null)`, and a throwing or absent
  `localStorage` (Safari private mode, quota) degrades instead of crashing.
- Tests: **67**, up from 57 — `tests/lessons.test.ts` and `tests/progress.test.ts`.

### Known cost

`import.meta.glob(…, { eager: true })` inlines the full text of all 679 lesson
files, so the bundle is ~1.56 MB (480 kB gzipped) and every startup parses them
all — even in Browse mode, which doesn't need them. Only the frontmatter
survives parsing; the bodies are discarded. A lazy glob or a build-time JSON
index would fix both; deferred rather than hidden.

### Three bugs worth recording

- **`process is not defined` at startup.** Importing the package's barrel
  (`index.ts`) pulled `cli.ts` and `loader.ts` — `process`, `node:fs` — into the
  browser bundle. The build *succeeded* and the app then died on load with a
  blank page. Fixed by deep-importing the pure module
  (`.../src/parse.ts`). Caught only by opening the app in a browser; no test or
  build step would have found it.
- **`vitest.config.ts` does not inherit `vite.config.ts`'s `server.fs.allow`.**
  The lesson glob reaches outside the package root, so tests failed with "Denied
  ID" until the same allowance was declared in both configs.
- **The "don't persist untouched items" guard failed open after one reload.**
  It tested `dueAtSession <= 0`, but fresh items are seeded with the *current*
  session, so from session 1 onward every unseen lesson looked touched: the
  payload grew from ~100 bytes to ~48 kB and the "started" count reported the
  whole curriculum. Now keyed on review history (`reps`/`lapses`/`box`) only,
  with a reload round-trip test that would have caught it — the original test
  only covered session 0, the one case where the bug was invisible.
